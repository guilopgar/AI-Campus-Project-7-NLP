Comment: The aspirates are pauci-cellular and reveal rare small clusters of malignant epithelial cells in a background of blood. Only rare. reactive bronchial cells and sparse inflammatory cells are present. The tumor cells are large with abundant granular cytoplasm and. well defined cell borders. The nuclei are enlarged and mildly pleomorphic with moderately irregular contours, coarse chromatin. and prominent central nucleoli. The morphologic findings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma. To confirm the diagnosis and. help exclude a primary lung tumor, we performed a panel of immunohistochemical stains on the cell block material with the. following results: Antibody. Usual reactivity. CD10. Renal cell marker,. Positive. Pan-keratin. Epithelial marker. Positive. CK 7. Epithelial marker. Positive. CK 20. Epithelial marker. Negative. RCC. Renal cell marker. Negative. CD 68. Histiocyte marker. Negative. TTF-1. Pulmonary cell marker. Negative. The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic diagnosis. Positive staining for CD10 and pan keratin with. negative staining for CK 20 is consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Although CK7 is often negative in most renal cell. carcinomas,. positive. staining can be seen in up to 1/3 of cases. Similarly, negative staining for RCC is seen in approximately 13% of cases. Negative. staining for CD68 indicated the tumor cells are not reactive pulmonary macrophages which can have similar morphology. in rare cases. Negative staining for TTF-1 also rules against a diagnosis of a primary lung carcinoma. Overall, based on. morphology and immunohistochemical findings the final diagnosis is that of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. have reviewed this case and concur with the diagnosis. LUNG, LEFT, NODULE, FNA: LESS THAN OPTIMAL - SCANT CELLULARITY. NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. HYPERCELLUALR SPECIMEN WITH REACTIVE EPITHELIAL CELLS AND BLOOD (see comment).

Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus. histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent. material in keeping with silicate. No tumour is identified within these nodes. Immediately adjacent to the tumour there is focal change within lung parenchyma. in keeping with obstructive pneumonitis characterised by focal organising. pneumonia, mild acute alveolitis, and a few collections of intra-alveolar foamy. macrophages. Marked emphysema is present. Associated with a mixed dust macule. there is a small non-necrotising granuloma. The separately described. macroscopic lesions represent foci of scarring and organising pneumonia. No. tumour is identified within these areas. 2: Sections of lymph node tissue reveal reactive changes with prominent sinus. histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent. material in keeping with silicate.

TCGA-77-A5G7,"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. No clinical notes supplied. MACROSCOPIC. One specimen submitted. The specimen is labelled `left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung. measuring 230 x 100 x 20 mm in the uninflated state. A number of bullous. structures are present at the apex of the lobe over an area 40 x 20 mm. There. is a small area of fibrous pleural thickening on the lateral aspect of the lobe. over an area approximately 20 x 20 mm. Beneath this area of thickening is a. palpable tumour mass. The pleura moves over this mass and does not appear to. be involved. At the hilum there are two bronchial profiles, 10 and 8 mm in. diameter. Very few peribronchial nodes are included. A stapled resection. line, 70mm in length, extends posteroinferiorly from the hilum. Transverse. slicing reveals an extensively necrotic tumour mass 25 x 25 x 20 mm, lateral to. the. hilum and approaching the lateral pleural surface. The cut surface of this. tumour has a variegated grey and yellow appearance. Adjacent to the tumour is. an ill defined area of yellowish discolouration of lung parenchyma measuring. approximately 10 mm in maximum dimension. There is also an ill-defined area of. parenchymal fibrosis adjacent to the tumour. Elsewhere the lung parenchyma. shows severe emphysematous changes. [1A, bronchial resection margin; 1B,. peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1E tumour with overlying pleura; 1F, area of. yellowish discolouration; 1G, ill-defined fibrous scar adjacent to tumour; 1H,. apical bulla; 1I, uninvolved lung parenchyma superior to tumour; 1J, involved. lung parenchyma inferior to tumour.]. MICROSCOPY. Sections show moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma measuring 25mm. in maximum dimension. There is extensive tumour necrosis with associated foamy. macrophages and cholesterol clefts. The periphery of the carcinoma has a. growth pattern filling air spaces. Extensive vascular invasion is present at. the periphery of the carcinoma together with focal perivascular lymphatic space. invasion, There is mild fibro-elastotic scarring of the visceral pleura. adjacent to the tumour but no evidence of pleural invasion by the carcinoma. The carcinoma is clear of the bronchial resection margin which shows focal. squamous metaplasia and mild squamous dysplasia. The area of yellow. discoloration adjacent to the carcinoma shows focal collapse, interstitial. fibrosis and localised obstructive changes including dilated air spaces. containing numerous macrophages and proteinaceous fluid. Within this region. there is a mildly dilated bronchiole showing focal moderate squamous dysplasia. There is also an area of dense fibrous scarring adjacent to the carcinoma. The. non-neoplastic lung shows scattered mixed dust macules and aggregates of. pigmented airspace macrophages. Apical bullous emphysema is present and this is. associated with subpleural fibrosis and prominent chronic inflammation together. with focal fibrous obliteration of the pleural space and a small amount of. 1 agezo. adherent chest wall fat. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus. histiocytosis and mild carbon pigment deposition but no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Left upper lobe: Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (25mm maximum dimension). Extensive vascular invasion present; focal lymphatic invasion present. Squamous metaplasia with mild dysplasia present at bronchial resection margin. No pleural invasion. No peribronchial lymph node involvement. Peritumoral scar and obstructive changes.

PART 5: OMENTUM, EXCISION -. POSITIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA. COMMENT: The carcinoma extensively involves the colonic wall, from the mucosa to the pericolic adipose tissue, but no definite. precursor lesion is seen in the colonic mucosa. There is extensive, plaque-like extramural/subserosal involvement as. well, with areas of serosal penetration and at least one focus where cauterized carcinoma is present at what appears to. be the radial and/or mesocolic specimen edge. This corresponds to the operative report describing dense tumor. infiltrating the pelvic sidewall over the iliac vessels, through which the surgeon cut. In addition, immunohistochemical. stains reveal the carcinoma to be strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 with only focal positivity for cytokeratin 20. CDX-2. is. completely negative, as are TTF-1 and PSA. CEA and cytokeratin 19 are positive. Positive immunostains for the DNA. mismatch repair proteins MLH-1, PMS-2, MSH-2 and MSH-6 reveal preserved nuclear expression. In summary, the overall. morphological findings and immunohistochemical profile are not typical of a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. A. possible primary site compatible with the immunomorphological findings is the pancreaticobiliary system. Alternatively,. if another potential primary site cannot be found clinically, this could be a primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma with. extension into the colonic wall. Finally, the lymph node total includes one lymph node confirmed to be negative for. carcinoma by a negative cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunostain.",T4,N2,M1,T4N2M1

MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING: Block E: A. Mutations in BRAF, NRAS61, HRAS61, KRAS12/13 NOT identified. B. FISH test results are negative for RET/PTC rearrangement. NOTE: DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. (1). BRAF V600E (. 1) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2, 3). The. association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary. microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in - -70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas. and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer, BRAF. V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they. have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid. tumors, being found in -40-50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papillary. carcinomas (6). 1.

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For. paraffin-embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of. tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the. platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting. curve. analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on. DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was. considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal. DNA. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: THYROID GLAND, RIGHT, LOBECTOMY (59 GRAMS) -. A.

HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit),. Control Slides Examined: External kit-slides. provided by manufacturer (cell lines with nign, low ana negauve HER2 protein expression), and in-house known. HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this. patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive. carcinoma identified for HER2 evaluation. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern. Negative (0)/Absence of Staining. Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not. indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for. (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical. Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: None given. ADDENDUM: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed mild polysomy 17 with 2. to 3 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 5 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. B20. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.65. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. /, under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Received are specimen containers A to E. nit. isitions and specimen containers are. labelled with the patient's name,. The cassettes and identifiers are. labelled with the Surgical Number. A: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""lymph node no 8"" and contains a 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm firm tan. yellow ovoid portion of tissue grossly consistent with a lymph node. On sectioning,. the. lymph node is firm, white, and grossly suspicious. The trisected lymph node is submitted. entirely in A1 and A2. B: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""portal lymph nodes"" and contains an irregular heavily. cauterized, 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm greyish tan tissue fragment. The fragment is bisected and. submitted in toto in B1. C: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""gallbladder"" and contains an intact unopened 6.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. gallbladder. The gallbladder serosa is smooth and shiny without nodules or adhesions,. and the adventitial surface is slightly roughened. The cystic duct is open. The cystic. duct margin is inked black. A 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm plump ovoid cystic duct lymph node is. present. The gallbladder lumen contains viscous green bile and no gallstones. The. gallbladder wall is thin, pliable, and approximately 2 mm thick. The gallbladder mucosa. is green and velvety with marked yellow speckling suggestive of cholesterolosis. There. are no polyps, masses or other lesions. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: C1. bisected cystic duct lymph node and black - inked cystic duct margin. C2. two representative sections of gallbladder mucosa, one from near gallbladder. neck and. one from fundus. D: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""Whipple's specimen"" and contains a 23 cm long portion of. duodenum with attached 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of the pancreatic head. The duodenum. has an average linear circumference of 4 cm, and the distal 13 cm of the duodenum shows. dusky ischemic discoloration. The duodenal mucosa has the normal pattern of folds,. without polyps or other lesions. The retroperitoneal margin (designated with a blue. suture) is inked blue and the SMA groove is inked green, and the pancreatic neck margin. is. inked black. A portion of the pancreatic duct is identified at the pancreatic neck. margin, but the duct appears occluded less than 1 cm from the margin. Replacing much of. the head of the pancreas, there is an ill-defined roughly 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm firm rubbery. tan white mass with infiltrative borders. On sectioning, the central portion of the mass. contains numerous cystic spaces filled with thin clear mucin. Grossly, the mass abuts. the retroperitoneal margin and the SMA groove but does not clearly involve those margins. The mass closely abuts the common bile duct, which contains a metal stent. The mass also. approaches to the level of the ampulla, but does not invade the wall of the duodenum. Numerous lymph nodes are identified in the surrounding peripancreatic fat, a few of which. are slightly enlarged and firm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1. proximal duodenal margin. D2. distal duodenal margin. D3. bile duct margin. D4. tumor with pancreatic neck margin. D5-7. three contiguous sections of tumor showing relationship of tumor with common. bile duct. and retroperitoneal margin. D8. one lymph node bisected (represents the remainder of the lymph node. previously. sampled in B5), one additional possible lymph node inked blue and submitted. whole.

D13. peripancreatic fat with possible lymph nodes. D14. two lymph nodes (one node inked blue and bisected). D15. one node bisected. D16. two lymph nodes (one node inked blue and trisected). D17. additional section of tumor with bile duct and ampulla. D18-19. central portion of tumor with cystically dilated spaces filled with mucin. D20. one lymph node trisected. D21. two lymph nodes (one node bisected, one node inked blue submitted whole). D22-25. additional peripancreatic fat with possible lymph nodes. E: The specimen consists of pink tan tissue measuring 2.2 x 1 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in. toto in E1. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container designated. ""pancreas neck"". The previously frozen tissue is entirely resubmitted for permanent. sections in EQS1. Frozen Section Diagnosis. E: Pancreatic Neck: Chronic inflammation with some dilated ducts. No malignancy in the sampled. sections. Pathologist Comment. E. Permanent sections of the pancreatic neck margin (i.e. slide E1-2) reveal rare. crushed atypical cells, present in pools of mucin surrounding a nerve, highly suspicious. for adenocarcinoma. These cells are not definitively identified in the original frozen. section slides. Since the frozen section represents the ""true"" margin, and the permanent. sections are cut from deeper (more distal) tissue, it is estimated that the true. pancreatic neck margin is negative but that tumor extends very close (likely 1-2 mm) to. this margin. In case ancillary studies are desired, tumor block information is listed below: Best tumor block: D9. Best normal block: C2. Encounter Number. Patient Location.",T3,N1,M0,T3N1M0

Received are specimen containers A in . requisitions and specimen containers are. labelled with the patient's name,. The cassettes and identifiers are. labelled with the Surgical Number. A. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated. as ""A - liver segment 6"". The specimen consists of a 131.8 gram, 10.0 x 5.6 x 5.9 cm. portion of liver. The capsular surface is smooth and predominantly tan with a focal. hemorrhagic area. The resection margin is painted blue. Sectioning reveals a 5.0 x 4.5. x 4.5 cm well demarcated multinodular mass which replaces most of the resected liver. The nodules are variably yellow green to tan with foci of hemorrhage and necrosis. The. mass comes to within 1.0 cm to the parenchymal resection margin. The remaining liver. parenchyma is brown, tan, slightly firm, and nodular. Sections are submitted as follows: A1-4. mass in relation to parenchymal resection margin with A1 demonstrating area. of necrosis. A5-7. lesion in relation to the capsule, A5-6 demonstrating areas of hemorrhage. A8-10. representative sections from remaining liver parenchyma. B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated. as ""B - right diaphragm and tumor"" The specimen consists of a 4.5 x 3.3 x 0.9 cm. irregular portion of grey-tan to dark brown tissue. One surface is grey-tan and smooth. The opposite surface is dark brown and roughened. Sectioning reveals a central area that. is light brown and homogeneous. Six representative sections are submitted in B1-B3. The. remaining specimen is submitted in toto following initial histologic examination in B4-. B6. C. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated. as ""C - right adrenal. The specimen consists of multiple portions of fibrofatty tissue. measuring in aggregate 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. The cut surface shows predominantly yellow. adipose tissue with areas of semi firm tan to hemorrhagic friable tissue. A definitive. adrenal gland is not identified. Sections are submitted as follows: C1. slightly firm tan to hemorrhagic tissue submitted in toto. C2-3. remainder of tissue submitted in toto. Pathologist Comment. The hepatocellular carcinoma shows a classical trabecular / sinusoidal growth pattern. with a few foci of acinar growth. The tumor is morphologically heterogeneous, ranging. from moderately differentiated to poorly differentiated with anaplastic cytology. While. the main tumor mass is excised with a 7 mm margin, there is extensive lymphovascular. invasion beyond the tumor capsule, and intralymphatic tumor is present within 2.4 mm of. the parenchymal resection margin. Cauterized fragments of tumor are present in blood. clot adherent to the diaphragm, but these may represent intraoperative artifact, and no. true invasion of the diaphragm is identified. Finally, the specimen designated ""adrenal"". shows adipose tissue with a large intravenous tumor embolus. No adrenal gland is. identified. Per discussion with Dr. this tissue was taken from the fat plane. between the liver and the adrenal, and therefore this may represent local extension of. tumor. Finally, the background liver shows cirrhosis (consistent with the known history of. hepatitis B) as well as a single well-formed non-necrotizing granuloma. Special stains. for infectious organisms are pending, and will be reported as an addendum. In case ancillary studies are desired, tumor block information is 'listed below: Best tumor block: A6.

Interpreted by: ADDENDUM: Reticulin stains are performed on two of the satellite nodules. (blocks C1 and E1) The stains show convincing loss of the. reticulin framework in both nodules, adding further support for the. diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple satellite. nodules. Given the mucinous character of the cut tumor surface, a mucicarmine. stain is performed on a representative tumor block (A2) . There is. a. faint pink blush in the dilated sinusoids, but no intracellular. mucin is identified. Some hepatocellular carcinomas can overexpress. mucin-related proteins (particularly MUC1) i that could possibly. account for both the gross and histochemical findings.",T3,N0,M0,T3N0M0

Page: 2 of 6. COMMENT. This case was initially signed out as a provisional report on. and has been amended to include results of immunohistochemical. stains. The diagnoses have not changed from the original report. The lymph nodes resected in the case (specimen 1-8) show diffuse. involvement with well-formed non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Occasional mixed dust nodules with central hyalinization and focal. central necrosis are also present. Special stains for fungal elements. and acid-fast organisms are negative. There is no evidence of metastatic. carcinoma in any of the lymph nodes examined. :ctions of the tumor in specimen 8 show predominately moderately. differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (90%) with a small component. (10%) of a poorly differentiated spindle cell carcinoma that demonstrates. shows multiple mitoses and severe cytologic atypia. There is no. malignant cartilage, bone, or skeletal muscle identified in the spindle. cell component. Immunohistochemistry shows the squamous cell component. of the tumor to be positive for multiple cytokeratins (HMWK, CK5/6,. E1/AE3) and p63. The spindled component shows weak positive staining. for CK5/6 and p63, with very focal positive staining for CK7. The EGFR. shows strong membranous staining in approximately 90% of both the. moderately differentiated. component and the spindled component. Both. components are negative for p53 and TTF-1. The findings are consistent. with a pleomorphic carcinoma composed of predominantly squamous cell. carcinoma (moderately differentiated, 90%) and pleomorphic spindle-cell. carcinoma (poorly differentiated, 10%), pT2NO. The residual lung parenchyma in both specimen 1 (""wedge resection right. middle lobe"") and specimen 8 (""right lower lobe"") shows patchy. interstitial fibrosis that appears accentuated in a subpleural. distribution, with focal areas of architectural remodeling and cyst. formation (microscopic honeycomb change) There is mild chronic. interstitial inflammation associated with areas of fibrosis.

TNM classification pT4 pN2 V1 RX, stage IIIB. C 34.1 M 8255/3. Comment/supplementary remark: The tumor is obviously primarily peripheral in location, has focally infiltrated the parietal. layer in the region of the pleural adhesion zone located over the tumor and is possibly. extending in a continuous perivascular sleeve into the hilum of the superior lobe, where it has. formed a further relatively large manifestation involving parabronchial lymph nodes. A. separate satellite focus can also be found in S3. The central tumor manifestation has infiltrated. the pulmonary venous wall and extends at least very close in the fatty tissue to the hilar. resection margin.

Printed from: : Page: 1 of 3. Anatomical Pathology results - Performed from. M. Histopathology. At least 1 Final Result. MICROSCOPIC: A. The sections show a lymph node laden with histiocytes containing carbon. pigment. Within the subcapsular sinus, there is one small focus of metastatic. mesothelioma, less than 1mm, with focal extra capsular extension to a distance. of less than 0. 5mm. B. The sections show shows a lymph node with one small focus, . 5mm, of. metastatic malignant mesothelioma. C. Multiple sections of the left extrapleural pneumonectomy were taken,. including the various resection margins from anterior and posterior pericardium,. anterior, posterior, lateral and medial diaphragm, parietal pleura and. mediastinal fat. The sections confirm malignant mesothelioma exhibiting. predominantly an epithelial growth pattern with a very small component. (5%). of. sarcomatous pattern. The vast majority of the tumour is characterised by. pavement-like sheets of large cells often exhibiting a microcystic growth. pattern with focal necrosis. There is abundant pale basophilic material,. confirmed to be hyaluronate on an Alcian blue/hyaluronidase stain. The malignant. cells possess monotonous, round to oval to mildly pleomorphic vesicular nuclei,. prominent nucleoli and abundant, often vacuolated cytoplasm. In focal areas the. cells exhibit a spindled morphology, intermixed with moderate amounts of dense. collagen. Lymphovascular space invasion is noted. There is extensive involvement of all parietal pleural resection margins. Tumour lies close to the anterior pericardial resection margin, as well as the. anterior, posterior, medial and lateral diaphragmatic resection margins. There. is subpleural extension into lung and extension to the internal surface of. the. pericardium. The sections also confirm invasion of the mediastinal fat. The. bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour and there is no invasion of the. bronchial tree at the hilum (described macroscopically). Of eight hilar lymph. nodes retrieved, one small lymph node shows near complete replacement by. metastatic tumour with extracapsular extension to a distance of 0. 5mm. D. The sections show a lymph node with abundant histiocytes containing carbon. pigment. There is no evidence of micrometastasis identified by light microscopy. CONCLUSION: A. Bronchial lymph node: Micrometastasis, less than 1mm, of metastatic. mesothelioma, with focal extracapsular extension. B. Mediastinal lymph node: Micrometastasis, of malignant mesothelioma. C. Extrapleural pneumonectomy: 1. Extensive involvement by malignant mesothelioma, predominantly of. epithelial pattern, with focal (5 % or less) sarcomatous pattern. 2. Tumour lies focally close to anterior pericardial resection margin and. anterior, posterior, medial and lateral diaphragmatic resection margins. There. is subpleural invasion of the lung parenchyma and extension to the internal. surface of the pericardium. Involvement beyond the parietal pleural margin is. extensive with invasion into mediastinal fat. Bronchial resection margin is. clear of tumour. 3. Of eight hilar lymph nodes, one is. positive with focal extracapsular. extension (1/8). D. Thymic lymph node: Negative for malignancy, no micrometastases.

The bronchial remnant measures 2.4. cm in length and 1.4 cm in diameter. The pericardium is inked green, the diaphragm margin is inked. black, the mediastinal soft tissue margin and perihilar pleural surface is inked blue. The pleura is. incomplete on the lateral aspect of the lung on both the upper and lower lobes (orange ink). The. diaphragmatic surface of the lung is also incomplete with an open defect showing a visibly necrotic. cavity within the lower lobe of the lung. No areas of puckering are present along the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned in a transverse plane to reveal a firm, gray-white mass with central necrosis. measuring 8 x 7 X 6 cm. The necrosis is more prominent in the most inferior aspect of the lung. The. greatest dimension of the mass is in the cranial caudal plane. The mass is present from the hilar region. and extends inferior through the lower lobe to the diaphragmatic aspect. The lung parenchyma adjacent. to the mass is soft and tan-orange. The upper and lower lobes are firmly adhered at the oblique fissure. in the area of the mass showing possible involvement in the upper lobe (section A14). The mass does. involve the bronchus and extending within 1.5 cm from the bronchial margin.

The specimen weighs 390 grams. The capsular surface is tan-brown,. with multiple irregular bosselated tan-white areas. measuring up to 2.0 X 1.5. cm on the superior surface and the inferior surface. The surgical resection. surface reveals tan-brown cauterization. Immediately adjacent to the surgical. resection surface, there is a segment of left hepatic bile duct. measuring 2.8. cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The distal end of the hepatic bile duct is. marked by a blue suture. The hepatic duct has been opened by the surgeon. Approximately 1.7 cm proximal to the surgical resection margin. there is an. adherent. intramural mass, measuring 0.8 X 0.6 x 0.3 cm. (Please note: In. the sections. the tumor appears to be on the outside of the hepatic bile. duct). The liver is serially sectioned and approximately 85% of the specimen. is replaced by an irregular tan-white mass. measuring 9.0 X 7.0 X 5.5 cm. The. mass is composed of lobulated tan-white firm tissue with focal hemorrhage. The. remaining portion of the specimen shows tan-brown hepatic parenchyma with. multiple small satellite lesions. measuring up to 0.6 cm in greatest. dimension. The surgical resection margin is 0.1 cm away from the mass. Multiple intraparenchymal bile duct lumina are completely occluded by the. tan-white firm tumor tissue.

One extends superiorly from the hilar margin. for a distance of 50 mm and the other extends inferiorly from the hilar margin for a distance of 90 mm. Each of these is trimmed and inked blue. The pleural surface is purple to pink in colour with. prominent anthracotic pigment. An area of pleural adhesion is present over the lateral aspect. In the. upper pole of the lobe there is a tumour. The tumour measures 80 mm in maximum dimension. The. tumour is subpleurally located and focally the pleural surface is distorted and puckered to the. underlying tumour. Fibrous adhesions are present overlying this area. The adjacent lung shows. emphysema. The tumour is located 20 mm from the bronchial resection margin and 10 mm from the. nearest surgical margin. The cut surface of the tumour varies from yellow to pink. Some of the pinker. areas have a very ""fish flesh"" appearance. Focal necrotic areas are also present.

NOTE: DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. (1). BRAF V600E (T1799A) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2, 3). The. association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary. microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in -70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas. and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer, BRAF. V600E. mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they. have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid. tumors,. being found in -40-50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papillary. carcinomas (6). 1.

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For paraffin-embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of. tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the. splatform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting. curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on. DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was. considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal. DNA. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: THYROID GLAND, TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY (29.5 GRAMS) -. A.

The H4 and 369 probes are approximately 100kb each (labeled in SpectrumOrange), and are located at band 10q21. RET/PTC rearrangement is suggested to be present when three RET signals are identified in greater than 8% of the analyzed. cells. RET /PTC1 rearrangement detection is as follows: Normal cells without the RET/PTC1 rearrangement show two pair of green and. orange signals separated. Cells with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement show two pair of signals (green and orange) in juxtaposition. and one green and one orange signal separated in greater than 8% of analyzed cells within the targeted area.

Liver, caudate margin, biopsy: Adenocarcinoma, present at the. non-inked cauterized margin; see comment. COMMENT: The periductal liver tissue (part E), left partial hepatectomy (part I),. and caudate margin of liver (part J) specimens show a. moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with irregular glands in a. desmoplastic stroma. Mitotic activity is readily identified (up to 4. mitotic figures/HPF} including atypical mitotic figures. Overall, the. morphologic features of the carcinoma are not specific for primary site. Immunohistochemical stains for CK7, CK19, CK20, and HepParl were. evaluated on block I5 to further characterize this tumor. Tumor cells. are negative for CK20, which argues against a lower GI tract origin and. négative for HepParl, which argues against a hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor cells show positive staining for CK7 and CK19, which is not. specific but is compatible with a cholangiocarcinóma if metastasis can. be excluded clinically. Tumor is transected at the margin of the main left liver lobe specimen. (part I) In the separately submitted ""caudate márgin"" (part J). specimen, the liver was received with blue ink on one surface of the. specimen. The remaining surgical margins on this specimen were inked. black and cauterized tumor is present at the black ink but not at the. blue ink surface. Correlation with operative findings is required in. order to determine the final margin status.

Date Complete: Addendum Diagnosis. 1. Left lateral bladder wall: The tumor has mixed histologic features. By immunostains, staining heterogeneity was present in the following markers: CK7,. CK20, GATA3, HMWK (34be12). p63/4A4 and CD117. Strong staining with p16 and focal synaptophysin was present. The tumor. was negative for chromogranin, PAX8, racemase, calponin, ERG and S100. There were focal areas of faint PSA and PSMA. labeling, which might suggest prostatic differentiation, but their true significance is not clear as the tumor is showing more. convincing differentiation along the urothelial phenotype. This case was discussed at the. Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved. by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes.

NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information. available at the time of this report, and is subject to change. pending clinical review and additional information. Comment: Based on the lack of clinical or radiologic evidence to support the. presence of a primary adenocarcinoma arising outside of the liver,. the presence of a 3.9 cm solitary mass in the left liver lobe. consisting of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma is consistent. with a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Special stains are performed on a section of liver parenchyma away. from the tumor mass. The liver is negative for significant iron. deposition. There is no evidence of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. (no DPAS positive globules identified within hepatocytes) . A. trichrome stain shows a mild increase in portal fibrosis.

PRE-OPERATIVE - DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma, right colon. POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same. CLINICAL INFORMATION: Same. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum, appendix and. ascending colon with attached mesocolon and omentum. Multiple adhesions are. seen on the surface of the specimen. The terminal ileum measures. approximately 7.0 X 3.0 cm. The colonic and cecal segment measures 15.0 X 2.5. cm. An area of induration and puckering is evident on the anterior aspect. just above what appears to be ileocecal valve. Opening the colon reveals a. large fungating ulcerated mass measuring approximately 8.0 X 9.0 cm involving. the full circumference of the colon. It has a central area of ulceration and. raised irregular erythematous edges. The appendix is dilated and measures 4.0. X 1.0 cm. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections through the tumor demonstrate a variable pattern. In areas, it. consists of atypical glandular structures formed by cells with irregular and. hyperchromatic nuclei. Additionally, areas consist of poorly differentiated. tumor. Here, the cells form solids nests and cords of spindle and polygonal. shaped cells without gland formation. The tumor invades the muscularis from. an ulcerated mucosal surface and extends into serosal tissues where it is. surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction. Sections through sixteen lymph nodes. disclose lymphoid hyperplasia and reactive changes, but no metastatic tumor. The resection margins are free of tumor as well. The serosal surfaces of the. bowel and appendix demonstrate chronic inflammatory changes. ====. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ASCENDING COLON WITH CONTIGUOUS TERMINAL ILEUM.

TCGA-A6-3809,"SPECIMEN. Extended right hemicolectiomy - subtotal colectomy. CLINICAL NOTES. PRE-OP DIAGNOSI : Carcinoma transverse colon. GROSS DESCRIPTION. Received fresh in a container labeled ""extended right. hemicolectomy - subtotal colectomy"" is a segment of bowel. consisting of 6 cm. of terminal ileum with 50 cm of contiguous. colon. There is a 30 X 11 X 1 cm. portion of omentum which is. adherent to the outer aspect of the colon wall over an area 6. X. 5. cm, with induration of the omentum in that area. The serosal. surface. of the bowel away from where the omentum is attached is glistening. and tan-pink. No appendix is present with the specimen. The bowel. is opened. The small bowel averages 4.5 cm. in circumference and. the. colon averages 8.5 cm. in circumference. The mucosa of the small. bowel is tan-pink, smooth, and glistening, with a normal pattern of. folds. There are no focal lesions in the small bowel. The colon is. notable for a circumferential mass, with the bowel 12 cm. in. circumference in this region, with this mass 9 cm. long and. maximally 1.2 cm. thick. Sectioning through the mass reveals the. tumor to invade through the bowel wall into fat in the region with. adherent omentum noted above, appearing to involve the omentum. The. tumor comes very near to, but does not clearly reach, the outer. margin. The tumor is 24 cm. from the distal resection margin. The. remainder of the colonic mucosa is tan-pink with edematous folds,. with additional polyps up to 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension.

Macroscopy: The specimen is labelled ""right middle and lower lobes (lung)"" and consists of. the right lower lobe and a portion of the right middle lobe. The specimen. measures 110 mm medial to lateral X 120 mm superior to inferior X up to 120 mm. anterior to posterior. Approximately 20 mm of middle lobe is present superior. to the lower lobe and the interlobar fissure appears obliterated by adhesions. The main bronchus bifurcates 20 mm from the resection margin. The first branch. runs horizontally towards the lateral surface and the second branch runs. inferiorly. Immediately after the bifurcation the first horizontal bronchus is. intimately involved with a large tumour mass. This tumour mass extends for 30. mm along the bronchus. Distal to this there is a large region of presumed. carnification. This area involves the posterior basal and lateral basal. segments and the apical segment. [Sections taken: BRM, 1A; two complete. sections through bronchial tumour, 1B-1C; section of RML resection margin to. include some carnification, 1D; section of lateral pleura with carnified lung,. 1E; section of basal pleura with carnified lung, 1F; sections of hilar lymph. nodes, 1G.]. Microscopy: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion is. arising from a bronchus. In this region the bronchus shows squamous metaplasia. with varying grades of dysplasia. Pleural invasion is not identified but. tumour extends into hilar fat adjacent to the pulmonary artery. There is no. blood vessel invasion but perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is. well clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is tumour present in. soft tissue adjacent to the pulmonary artery margin. Peribronchial lymph node. metastases are seen and there is tumour within an extracapsular lymphatic. supplying the node. The carnified distal lung shows prominent organising. pneumonia with an associated granulomatous reaction. 2: LYMPH NODE NO. 7. Macroscopy: The specimen is labelled ""No. 7"" and consists of a piece of tissue measuring 40. X 25 x 15 mm. On sectioning, this tissue is consistent with lymph node with. marked anthracosis. [Complete section through the node taken, 1A-1B.] No. focal lesions are identified. Page 1 of. Histopathology Report. Microscopy: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of. malignancy. Summary: Right middle and lower lobes and lymph nodes: 1: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 30 mm in maximal dimension. 2: Perineural and lymphatic permeation identified; no blood vessel invasion. present. 3: No pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin but present. adjacent to pulmonary artery margin. 4: Peribronchial lymph node metastases. 5: T1N1MX.

Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Unfortunately, the tissue is largely absent on permanent sections and can only be. seen well on the frozen section. Ancillary studies like IHC are not possible. The epithelioid cells may. represent histiocytes or potentially a hyperplastic mesothelial proliferation. There is no evidence of. carcinoma, and I favor a benign process in this nodule.

NOTE: DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. (1). BRAF V600E. ) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2, 3). The. association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary. microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in - -70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas. and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer, BRAF. V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they. have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid. tumors, being found in -40-50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papillary. carcinomas (6). 1.

Specimens with the minimum of 50% of. tumor. cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the. platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting. curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on. DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was. considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal. DNA. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: PART 1: THYROID, TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY (22 GRAMS) -. A.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12. of the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor. prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection.

Immunohistochemical studies were performed on representative. blocks of axillary. lymph nodes (C6 and C7) and the results are as follows: CD20: Highlights many small lymphocytes in a generally nodular. distribution. CD3: Highlights majority of lymphocytes with focal expansion of. the paracortex. Interpretation: The immunohistochemical studies highlight an. essentially normal. pattern of distribution of B cells and T cells in the lymph. nodes, with primary. follicles composed predominantly of small B lymphocytes and. a. paracortex. populated by predominantly small T lymphocytes. Morphologic and. immunohistochemical findings are compatible with reactive lymph. nodes and do not. support a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The mild. paracortical. expansion can be seen as a feature of dermatopathic. lymphadenopathy.",T2,N0,M0,T2N0M0

TCGA-AK-3443,"Clinical History/Diagnosis: Right Renal Mass. Source of Specimen(s): 1: Right kidney. 2: Portion of right adrenal. Gross Description: Received in two parts. Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, ""right kidney"". Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled ""right kidney"". It consists of a. right kidney weighing 850. grams and measuring 15.0 x 11.0 X 10.5 cm. The kidney is markedly. distorted from numerous bulging areas and it is grossly enlarged. Superiorly at the hilum is some residual adrenal gland measuring 1.5 X 1.0. X 0.6 cm that is otherwise unremarkable. Also at the hilum are a few tan. to brown rubbery to firm nodes measuring from 0.7 up to 1.5 cm. The nodes. have tan to brown cut surfaces. A segment of ureter measures 6.0 X 0.3 cm. and is grossly unremarkable. Also at the hilum the vessels are. unremarkable however, there is multiple bulging areas from the kidney. Perinephric fat is only present in a few areas ranging from 0.1 up to 0.5. cm. Some of the fat that is overlying some of the nodules will be. submitted for histological impression. Elsewhere, the capsule overlying. the presumed tumor nodules are inked black and will be submitted in. relationship to the kidney lesion. The specimen is bivalved disclosing a. yellowish-orange soft tumor measuring 12.0 x 9.0 x 9.5 cm comprising. approximately 80% of the kidney. The tumor markedly distorts the calyceal. system and is pushing into the renal pelvis and capsule. No gross. invasion into the aforementioned areas is identified. Fresh tissue was. prepared for. in the mass there is. some white fibrous possible scar and an appreciable amount of hemorrhage. The adjacent uninvolved parenchyma has slight scarring and well-defined. cortical-medullary junctions. Representative sections are submitted in. 1A-P. Designation of Sections: 1A- ureter and vascular margins, 1B- tumor in. relationship to renal pelvis, 1C-1D- tumor in relationship to capsule, 1E-. center of tumor, 1F- tumor in relationship to adjacent uninvolved kidney. parenchyma, 1G- tumor overlying fat, 1H- residual adrenal gland, 1I-1J-. lymph nodes K-1P- additional section of tumor. Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, ""portion of right adrenal"". Gross Description: Received fresh labeled,. portion of right adrenal"" is a 6 gram, 5.0 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm portion of. adrenal gland. It is sectioned to reveal golden-yellow-orange unremarkable. cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted in two blocks. Designation of Sections: 2A-2B. Summary of Sections: multiple. Final Diagnosis: 1. Right kidney and adrenal gland, nephrectomy and partial adrenalectomy: - Renal oncocytic neoplasm, 12 cm, confined to renal parenchyma (see. note). - Vascular and ureteral margins, free of tumor. - Adrenal gland, no tumor seen. - Seven lymph nodes, no tumor seen (0/7). Note: Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor is positive for E-Cadherin. (membranous staining), many cells positive for CK7, and weakly positive. for Vimentin, whereas negative for CD10, CK903, and CD117 (only. cytoplasmic staining). Special stain colloidal iron shows many cells with. strong, granular cytoplasmic staining. Mucicarmine special stain is. negative. Differential diagnosis includes low grade chromophobe carcinoma. versus atypical Oncocytoma. Cytogenetic study is pending, and the result. may assist the differential diagnosis. 2. Portion of adrenal, completion of adrenalectomy: - Adrenal gland, no tumor seen. Procedures/Addenda. FC Cytogenetics Solid Tumor. Results-Comments. CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS. DIAGNOSIS: Right Renal Mass. KARYOTYPE: Normal male karyotype: 46,XY[20]. RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after thirteen days in culture. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and analyzed, and. three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The modal. chromosome number was 46, and the cells appeared to have a normal. karyotype. These normal results may reflect an overgrowth of normal. interstitial tissue rather than tumor. Procedures/Addenda. Addendum. Addendum Diagnosis. The cytogenetic analysis. reveals a normal. karyotype. The histomorphology is that of an atypical oncocytoma, however, foci of. the tumor are strongly positive for colloidal iron, and many cells are. positive for CK7. Thus, an oncocytic neoplasm with low malignant. potential is favored, which is a borderline neoplasm between oncocytoma. and chromophobe carcinoma.",T2,N0,M0,T2N0M0

Five specimens received: 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measuring 155 x 95 x. 58 mm in the fresh state. Below the hilum there is a firm tumour which measures 68 x 65 mm in. maximal dimension and has a firm sclerotic cut surface. Towards the superior aspect of this there is a. firm node which is adherent to the medial aspect of the tumour. Further enlarged nodes are present. surrounding the inferior aspect of the bronchial resection margin and pulmonary artery. The tumour. abuts the pleural surface on this medial aspect but appears clear of the lateral aspect by approximately. 10 mm. On sectioning there are areas of necrosis and the tumour has a sclerotic cut face. Elsewhere. there is apical scarring. Distal to the tumour there is evidence of obstructive pneumonitis and in the. basal aspect of the lung there is a firm grey nodule. The lymph node superior to the tumour measures. 15 mm in diameter while the lymph node inferior to the tumour measures 23 mm in diameter. [Bronchial resection margin, pulmonary artery and peribronchial lymph node, 1A; enlarged inferior. peribronchial lymph node, 1B; enlarged superior peribronchial lymph node, 1C; tumour, 1D-1F; lateral. pleura and obstructive pneumonia, 1G; random sections of lung, 1H; grey nodule in lower zone, 11.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled ""pulmonary artery margin"" and consists of a segment of vessel. measuring 7 x 6x4 mm. [BIT]. 3: The third specimen is labelled ""L lower lobe node"" and consists of fragments of blackened lymph. node measuring 16 x 13 x 4 mm in aggregate. [Largest piece bisected and all wrapped and blocked in. toto.]. 4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""No. 5"" and consists of several pieces of lymph node invested in fat. and measuring 20 x 15 x 14 mm. [Bisected and blocked in toto, 4A]. 5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""lingula L lung"" and consists of two pieces of blackened lymph node,. each measurino 4 mm and 17 mm in maximal dimension. [Blocked in toto, 5A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. Vascular invasion is present but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or. perineural invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no. evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confirmed adjacent to the. tumour. Away from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule. noted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells. of Langhans type with surrounding lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis. are present within this nodule. There are two further foci of granulomatous inflammation with. extensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophages and fibrosis. These appear to be. centred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. However the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria. have been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confirmed to contain. metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification,. but they show no evidence of granulomatous inflammation. 2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of. pigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. 4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of. pigmented macrophages. There is no evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections show fragments of lymph node and surrounding fat. There is no evidence of metastatic. squamous cell carcinoma. SUMMARY. Left upper lobectomy and lymph node sampling: 1: Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 68 mm in diameter. Vascular invasion present. No pleural, lymphatic or perineural infiltration seen,. Bronchial and pulmonary artery resection margins clear of malignancy. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in peribronchial lymph nodes.

Received fresh in a container labeled ""right upper. lobe"" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 cm, lung lobe compatible. with right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 cm long. and 1.5 cm in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly. unremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly. unremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 cm in. greatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is. pink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There is some. retraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and. there is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 Cm rubbery tan-white mass underlying the. area with pleural retraction, with the mass suggestive of invading. the pleura. Approximately 2 cm from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5. x 3. Cm rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near. to the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange. discoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. The remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without. additional lesions.

The following template summarizes the findings in this. case: Histologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly. differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is. favored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent. foci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). Although not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) These two lesions are grossly 2.6 cm and 4 cm. in greatest dimension. The 2.6 cm in diameter lesion has visceral. pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very. peripherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. Although it is difficult to definitely distinguish between. synchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same. process, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new. guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. would be classified as pT3. Clinical correlation is recommended. Margins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins. are negative.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Elastic. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK were sent on. for patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1B appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12V (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12. of the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor. prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under. the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand along test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 4% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Macroscopy: The specimen consists of left lung, the upper lobe measuring 290 x 110 x 40 mm. and the lower lobe measuring 275 x 110 X 65 mm. Present 30 mm from the. proximal resection margin there is a white sclerotic nodule measuring 32 mm in. maximal dimension. It appears to be arising from the main bronchus and where. it branches into the bronchus supplying the lower lobe. The mucosa of the. bronchus surrounding the tumour is somewhat nodular but this does not extend to. the margin. The tumour appears to invade into adjacent lymph nodes and has a. sclerotic appearance. No other lesions are seen. On sectioning of the. uninvolved lung, there is some black anthracotic speckling. The tumour appears. clear of the pleura by approximately 7 mm. [Sections taken: bronchial. resection margin, A; peribronchial lymph nodes, B-C; tumour and proximal. bronchus, D; further RS of tumour, E-G; RS right upper lobe, H; lower lobe, I]. Microscopy: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which is. arising around large bronchi and extending into peribronchial soft tissue. Perineural permeation and areas suspicious for lymphatic invasion are seen but. no blood vessel invasion is identified. Peribronchial lymph node involvement. is noted. The tumour is clear of bronchial, soft tissue and pleural margins. Adjacent to the carcinoma, in situ squamous cell carcinoma is seen. Again,. this is well clear of the bronchial margin. The adjacent lung shows mild. emphysema. 2: HILAR NODES. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a piece of fatty tissue containing blackened lymph. node tissue. It measures 24 x 16 x 10 mm.

TCGA-77-8140,"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. Right upper lobe mass. 1: Right lower lobe lung. 2: Right level 4 lymph node. 3: Right middle lobe lymph node. MACROSCOPIC. Five specimens received: 1: The second specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe for frozen section"" and. consists of a nodule measuring 17 x 9 x 6 mm. Frozen section diagnosis: Organising pneumonia with a BOOP pattern. Phoned to. [Residual frozen section fragments remnants blocked, 1A.]. 2: The first specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe nodule"" and consists of a. wedge of lung tissue measuring 20 X 13 X 5 mm. The tissue contains a pale. glistening nodule measuring approximately 7 mm in diameter. Frozen section diagnosis: Organising pneumonia. Phoned to. [Frozen section remnants blocked, 2A. Remaining fragments sectioned into 4RS. and blocked, 2B.]. 3: The third specimen is labelled ""right lower lobe"" and consists of a right. lower lobe of lung measuring 115 X 90 x 80 mm. The pleural surface appears. largely puckered, extending from the diaphragmatic surface of the lung and from. the posterior to anterior pleural surfaces. A large firm mass is palpable. beneath the area of pleural puckering. On sectioning, a large tumour mass is. confirmed, measuring 60 x 48 x 70 mm. The tumour has a cream to yellow cut. surface with areas of grey to black mottling. The tumour appears to approach. both the posterior and anterior and diaphragmatic surfaces. The tumour is. approximately 6 mm away from the medial pleural margin. On opening of the. bronchial tree, the tumour appears to arise from a bronchial branch. approximately 10 mm away from the bronchial resection margin. A large vessel. runs through the middle of the tumour. However it does not appear. macroscopically invaded. The uninvolved lung parenchyma appears unremarkable. [Bronchial resection margin, 3A; peribronchial lymph nodes, 3B; tumour with. anterior pleural margin, 3C; tumour with posterior pleural margin, 3D; tumour. in relation to bronchus, 3E; vascular resection margin and section through. tumour with large vessel, 3F; tumour with diaphragmatic pleural surface, 3G;. uninvolved lung, 3H.]. Page 1 of. Histopathology Report. 4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""right lymph node"" and consists of a lymph. node measuring 10 x 8 X 6 mm. The node has a pinkish red cut surface and is. soft. [Specimen bisected, wrapped and blocked in toto, 4A.]. 5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""middle lobe lymph node and consists of two. lymph nodes, the first measuring 20 x 12 x 10 mm and the second 12 x 7 X 9 mm. Both nodes feel firm and on sectioning have a cream cut surface. [Each node. bisected and one-half blocked, 5A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1-2: The specimens are similar. Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section. diagnosis of organising pneumonia. In areas the pneumonia has a BOOP-type. pattern. Fibrinous exudate is present on the pleural surface. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour shows focal clear cell change. It is subpleural and there is a. suspicion of pleural invasion in an area of pleural scarring. Fibrinous. exudate but no tumour is present on the pleural surface. Focal blood vessel. invasion is present but there is no lymphatic permeation. Many of the. pulmonary arteries show fibrous intimal thickening and focally there are. features of a previously recanalised thrombus. The vessel infiltrated by. carcinoma appears distal to this. No perineural permeation is identified. The. lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is mild active. chronic inflammation, squamous metaplasia with moderate dysplasia. Metastatic. deposits are noted within a peribronchial lymph node. The adjacent lung shows. evidence of emphysema, organising pneumonia and nodules of luminal fibrin. 4: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections of the lymph nodes show extensive replacement by metastatic. squamous cell carcinoma. SUMMARY. Right lower lobe and lymph nodes: 1: Moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 70 mm in. maximal dimension. 2: Blood vessel permeation identified but no lymphatic or perineural invasion. present. 3: Possible pleural invasion identified, special stains being performed; clear. of bronchial margin. 4: Peribronchial and right middle lobe lymph node metastases. 5: T2N1MX.

Steatohepatitis is a non-specific pattern of injury seen most commonly with. morbid obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and alcohol abuse. However, it. can also be associated with nutritional causes, such as protein-calorie. malnutrition, starvation, rapid weight loss, and various intestinal bypass or. gastric stapling surgeries. Hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis can also be the result of medications,. including amiodarone, perhexiline maleate, glucocorticoids, synthetic. estrogens, calcium channel blockers, tamoxifen, nethotrexate, valproic acid,. cocaine, and anti-viral agents (Zidovudine, Didanosine, and Fialuridine). Metabolic disorders can also cause steatosis and steatohepatitie: hyperlipidemia, Wilson'e disease, adult onset citrullinemia (type II). lipodyst rophy tysbetalipoproteinemia, Weber-Christian-Disease, Wolman's. Disease, Cholesterol ester storage disease, and fatty liver of pregnancy.

Remark/addendum: The tumor extends to the adherent part of the parietal pleura and the soft portions of the co-resected parts of the. chest wall. With regard to the localization data, sample 3.) shows a discontinuous spread of the carcinoma. within pleura enlarged by fibrosis and showing fibrinous chronic inflammation, although no conclusion can be. drawn as to whether this is a visceral or parietal layer. The resection margins of bronchus and vessels of the. main preparation, the costal segments of the chest wall tissue, the repeat resection material from the pleura in. sample 1.) and all excised lymph nodes are tumor-free. The R1 category is explained by the fact that the tumor. has spread focally as far as resection surface of the adherent part of the parietal pleura adjacent to the chest wall. No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes, but much further-reaching investigations,. especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung.",T4,N0,M0,T4N0M0

Lymph node, left axilla, dissection: Metastatic ductal carcinoma in two of fourteen. (2/14). Working Draft. C. Lymph node, left axilla level III, biopsy: No tumor in one (0/1). D. Left breast, modified radical mastectomy: 1. Invasive ductal carcinoma, SBR grade 3, 6.5 cm; see comment. 2. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), high grade, micropapillary and cribriform. patterns, with comedonecrosis, narrowly excised; see comment. 3. Invasive carcinoma present at inked anterior-superior resection margin; see. comment. 4. Microcalcifications in DCIS. 5. Non-proliferative fibrocystic change with apocrine metaplasia and microcysts. 6. Benign sclerosing papilloma. E. Left breast, anterior/superior/medial margin, excision: Invasive ductal carcinoma,. SBR grade 3, close to inked margin; see comment. F. Skin, left breast nodule, excision: 1. Invasive ductal carcinoma, SBR grade 3, present in dermis, subcutaneous tissue. and fibrous tissue; see comment. 2. Fibrous tissue, suggestive of scar, with invasive tumor; see comment. G. Skin, newest anterior/superior/medial margin, excision: No significant pathologic. abnormality, no tumor. H. Left breast, new nipple margin, biopsy: Benign lactiferous ducts, no in situ or. invasive tumor. I. Non-sentinel lymph node #1, dissection: No tumor in two (0/2). J. Non-sentinel lymph node #2, biopsy: No tumor in one (0/1). Note: The tumor present in the main mastectomy specimen (part D) encompasses a 7.5 cm maximal. area, which includes an area of tumor satellites adjacent to a 6.5 cm solid tumor mass. The tumor. consists of infiltrating trabeculae, nests and glands of cells with ample and mostly clear cytoplasm,. and large pleomorphic nuclei with nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures are present. Ductal carcinoma in. situ is also present with cribriform, micropapillary, and comedo patterns, and shows cytology similar to. that of invasive tumor, with cells showing clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic high-grade nuclei. The. DCIS is present only as scattered foci admixed within the invasive carcinoma itself. Material from the. patient's prior biopsy (. ) shows analogous features. Invasive carcinoma are present at the inked anterior-superior margin of the main specimen (slides D2,. D3; see details in synoptic below), however, the separately submitted additional margin (part E),. shows invasive tumor that is narrowly (<0.5mm) excised (slide E8). In this specimen (part E), there. is also tumor extending to the edges of the specimen that were indicated by the surgeon as not the. new margin. The skin nodule (part F) shows invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 cm) within the subcutaneous tissue,. dermis and immediately beneath the epidermis, where it is seen to involve an area of fibrosis that is. suggestive of a skin scar. The tumor is within 0.5 mm of the excision margin, however, the separately. submitted new skin margin (part G) shows no tumor. The extensive clear cell features and nested architecture of the tumor are morphologic features that. are often seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, this possibility was considered and. immunohistochemical studies were performed and evaluated on a lymph node metastasis (block B7). and interpreted as follows: Working Draft. CD10: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Renal cell carcinoma Ab (RCC): Positive (result supports renal tumor). Cytokeratin 7: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). E-Cadherin: Positive (result does not support renal tumor). Estrogen receptor: Negative (result does not support renal tumor). Overall, while RCC Ab is positive, all other stains are indicative of this being metastatic breast. carcinoma in a lymph node that has features mimicking RCC. Breast Tumor Synoptic Comment. - Laterality: Left. - Invasive tumor type: Invasive ductal carcinoma. - Invasive tumor size: 6.5 cm maximum diameter (calculated by the presence of tumor in 4. consecutive 1.6 cm thick slices).

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block A1. (lymph node). The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in > 70% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is at least weak nuclear staining in > 10% of. tumor cells, with strong staining in ~5% of tumor nuclel. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is indeterminate for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A1 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test. interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoproteln. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

(a-m) Left superior pulmonary lobe: resected lobe weighing 634g, and measuring 240 x 130 x 60 mm, with. remnants of pleural adhesion and, adhering tightly to the hilar section, a pericardial lobe measuring 75 x 50 mm,. with slightly whitish thickening and subhemorrhaging. In S 3 there is grayish-white, brittle, yellowish necrosis. and anthracotic pigment including a polycyclic, well demarcated tumor, measuring 75 X 50 x 95 mm, extending. under the pericardial lobe described and, with unclear demarcation, to the adjacent subpleural and mediastinal. adipose tissue. B3 is tumorous in the intermediary section and destructed. The remaining segmental bronchi,. which can be dissected up to the periphery, are unremarkable. In the hilar section there are anthracotic. pigmented and swollen, non-tumorous lymph nodes. In the peritumoral pulmonary tissue there is a golden-. yellow, mesh-like parenchymal image (xanthomatous retention pneumonia?) and in S 1, accentuated in the. apical section, there is clear pulmonary emphysema with a coarse structure and possible honeycomb lung. 2. Phrenic nerve: Grayish-brown, restiform excised material, 6 mm in length. 3.

COMMENT: The histomorphology of the tumor shows a diffuse malignant mesothelloma with a predominantly epitheliold variant. However, a tubulopapillary pattern is focally seen. Addendum. Probe: Dual Color Probe. RESULTS : Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on the malignant mesothelioma demonstrate 1 (1.6%) cells with. homozygous loss and 10 (15.6%) of cells with hemizygous loss. The ratio of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of chromosome. 9 was 0.95. The targeted region (total 64 cells) is considered to be NEGATIVE for p16 (9p21) deletion. Interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH: Ratio of p16 to the centromère of chromosome 9: Normal Range Ratlo: 0.85-1.19. Normal % deletion: less than 20%. Clinical studies indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16 deletion in malignant mesotheliomas. FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells. Reference: Illei P, Ladanyi M, Rusch V, Zakowski M.

Mutations in NRAS61, HRAS61, KRAS12/13, and RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3 and PAX8/PPARg. rearrangements NOT identified. Note: The BRAF mutation was identified and confirmed by direct sequencing. However, low levels of mutant DNA were seen. despite quite pure population of epithelial cells tested (based on the ratio of GAPDH and KRT7 controls), which indicates. that a small fraction of tumor cells is positive for this mutation. The prognostic importance of BRAF mutation when. present in a small fraction of tumor cells is not known and may be less significant as compared to a more typical. situation when this mutation is found at high level. Nucleic acids were extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. Amplification of GAPDH and KRT7 controls was. acceptable.Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary. thyroid carcinomas (1). BRAF V600E. i) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary. carcinoma (2) and may be used for preoperative risk stratification of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (3). Mutations. in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in ~70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency. in oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinomas (4). Based on a recent prospective study of FNA samples (5) and our experience at. i, detection of BRAF mutations and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements in thyroid FNA samples correlated. with -100% probability of cancer, whereas detection of RAS mutation correlated with malignancy in 83-87% of cases and. with. benign follicular adenoma or hyperplastic nodule in 13-17%. However, single cases of false-positive BRAF mutation. detection in thyroid FNA samples have been reported in the literature (6) and therefore the results of molecular testing. should be interpreted in combination with clinical information, Imaging, and cytology. 1.

Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2006, 65(5):660-6. Sample Preparation and Procedure. Thyroid FNA samples were collected in the nucleic acid preservative solution. For cytology samples and frozen samples, extraction of DNA. and. RNA was performed from the sample provided using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the /. if platform to amplify BRAF, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13. sequences. Post-PCR melting curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. Single-step real-time RT-PCR was performed to amplify the. fusion points of RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3, and PAX8-PPARg rearrangements on ABI7500. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by. sequencing of the PCR products on. Sanger. implification of the GAPDH and KRT7 genes was used to control quality and quantity of RNA and. amount of epithelial cells present in the specimen. DNA or RNA from samples positive for each of these mutations were used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10% of alleles with mutation. present in the background of normal DNA and RNA. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: PART 1: THYROID, TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY (29 GRAMS)-. A.

TCGA-78-7167,"HISTORY. Pneumonectomy. Left pneumonectomy. Left lung cancer. Left lower lobe crossing fissure into lingula. MACROSCOPIC. Four specimens received. The specimen is labelled ""left lung"" and comprises a left lung, 240 X 170 x 40 mm in the fresh state. A. 30 mm length of bronchus protrudes from the hilum. There is an area of induration and puckering on. the lateral aspect of the pleura of the lower lobe. There is also an area of induration and puckering in. the interlobar fissure. A further area of induration is present posterolaterally on the upper lobe. A. number of emphysematous bullae are present at the apex and in the anterior margin of the upper lobe. Serial parallel slicing through the lung parenchyma reveals a tumour mass approximately 65 mm in. greatest diameter abutting the pleura of the lateral aspect of the lower lobe. This tumour has a fleshy,. grey, somewhat mucoid, cut surface. Posteriorly it merges with adjacent lung parenchyma and its full. extent is difficult to appreciate macroscopically. At its upper aspect, in the region of previously noted. puckering in the interlobar fissure, tumour appears to cross into the upper lobe. There is extensive. greyish-white consolidation extending from this point anteriorly into the lingula. It is unclear whether. this represents tumour or infective consolidation. Beneath the area of puckering noted on the postero-. lateral aspect of the upper lobe, there is a separate area of parenchymal consolidation and possible. fibrosis. The remainder of the upper lobe parenchyma appears emphysematous. In the lower segments. of the lower lobe there is no evidence of emphysema and there is very little anthracosis. However, on. the medial aspect, towards the diaphragmatic surface of the lung, there is an area of plaque-like pleural. thickening approximately 10 mm in diameter and 2-3 mm in depth. [1A, bronchial resection margin. and peribronchial lymph nodes; 1B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1E, tumour and overlying lateral. pleura; 1F, tumour within interlobar fissure; 1G, lingular consolidation; 1H, subpleural consolidation. and fibrosis in posterolateral aspect of upper lobe; 1I, representative upper lobe parenchyma; 1J,. plaque like nleural Lesion from medial aspect of lower lobe]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""aortopulmonary window"" and consists of three irregular reddish-brown. pieces of fatty tissue which measure in aggregate 10 X 10 X 2 mm. [BIT, 2A]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""inferior pulmonary ligament"" and consists of an ovoid-shaped piece of. greyish-black tissue, 12 X 7 X 5 mm, which has a smooth outer surface and is covered in a small. amount of fat. [Bisected and BIT, 3A]. 4: The specimen is labelled ""lymph node"" and consists of two irregular nodular pieces of tissue which. have a slate-grey appearance. The larger piece measures 18 X 5 x 4 mm and the smaller piece measures. 15x4x2 mm [Each portion of tissue is BIT, 4A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show that the majority of the tumour comprises well-differentiated papillary. adenocarcinoma. Focally there is stromal invasion by moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a. more usual acinar architecture, Tumour abuts but does not invade the lateral pleura. However, at its. superior aspect it does cross the interlobar fissure into the upper lobe (1F), and there is extensive. contiguous infiltration of the lingula (1G). The abnormal area in the posterolateral aspect of the upper. lobe (1H) is an entirely separate deposit of histologically identical papillary adenocarcinoma with. adjacent fibroelastotic scarring and emphysema. This presumably represents a metastasis, although a. synchronous primary tumour cannot be excluded. Definite vascular or lymphatic invasion is not. identified in any of the sections, and none of the peribronchial lymph nodes contains metastatic. adenocarcinoma. The plaque-like pleural lesion on the medial aspect of the lower lobe appears to. represent artefactual diathermy injury. 2-4: Sections of each of the separately submitted lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic. adenocarcinoma. SUMMARY. Left pneumonectomy: Papillary adenocarcinoma of left lower lobe, 65 mm in diameter, crossing interlobar fissure into left. upper lobe. Separate focus of adenocarcinoma in left upper lobe. No vascular or lymphatic invasion found. No lymph node metastases. Pathological stage T2 NO ?M1. T-28000 M-81403 P1-03000.",T2,N0,M1,T2N0M1

Received is a single specimen container The requisition and specimen container are. labelled with the patient's name,. The cassette and. identifiers are. labelled with the Surgical Number. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container. is. designated ""Liver segment 3"". This consists of a segmental resection of liver tissue,. weighing 201 g and measuring 9.5 cm across the surgical resection margin x 7.5 cm. perpendicular to the resection margin x 6.0 cm. The shape of the specimen appears. to. be. a. protuberant nodule beneath the capsule of the liver. The capsule appears grossly intact. The resection margin is painted blue. Much of the sample is occupied by a well rounded,. multinodular tumor that shows areas of hemorrhage and possible necrosis. Some of the. smaller lobulated nodules are also discolored green. The tumor measures 8.5 x 7.0 x 6.0. cm. This mass extends close to the capsule with areas of sclerosis on the capsular. surface. Between the tumor mass and the resection margin is a zone of parenchyma with. a. nodular, cirrhotic appearance. The tumor lies 0.6 cm from the margin at its nearest. point. There is no gross evidence of vascular invasion. Towards one side there appears to. be attached adipose tissue on the capsular surface overlying the tumor. Sections are. taken as follows: A1 to 4. tumor with nearest resection margin. AS to 8. tumor with capsular surface. A9/10. additional sections of tumor. A11/12. liver parenchyma away from tumor mass. Microscopic Description. Sections show hepatocellular carcinoma with the typical nodular and trabecular growth. pattern with broad trabeculae, mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and scattered. mitotic activity. The morphology is compatible with grade II hepatocellular carcinoma. There is one focus with venous invasion at the edge of the tumor nodule, but no distant. venous invasion can be seen. The resection margins are clear by 6 mm on the histology. evaluation. The liver capsule shows fibrous thickening overlying the tumor, but there is. no clear evidence of extracapsular extension and the adherent adipose tissue is not. involved. The adjacent liver shows well developed cirrhosis. There are well preserved portal. tracts, but architecture between portal tracts and central venules is disturbed with. multiple small nodules. There is a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the portal tracts. and fibrous septae focally aggregating into nodules, but also focally showing spill over. and obscuring of the liver cell plates, consistent with mild and focal interface. hepatitis. This is mostly made up of small lymphocytes, but plasma cells can be easily. found. There is minimal fatty change in the parenchyma and minimal hemosiderin. accumulation. No other abnormal inclusions can be seen. Immunostains for hepatitis. surface and core antigen are negative. The etiology of the underlying cirrhosis is. difficult to ascertain, but the areas with lymphoid aggregates and the past history of. documented Hep C would be compatible with this being the main etiology. The presence of. plasma cells always the consideration of autoimmune hepatitis, but the morphology is not. specific. An additional finding that might correlate with the imageing are areas with. bile duct dilation and aggregation in the fibrous septa recapitulating the pattern of Von. Meyenbergs complexes, but more comptible with secondary change due to the cirrhosis. Encounter Number. Patient Location.",T2,N0,M0,T2N0M0

The specimen is received fresh, labeled ""sigmoid colon"" and consists of. a. segment colon measuring 16.2cm in length with a circumference of 5.0 cm at. the stapled resected margin and 4.8 cm the open resected margin. Focally. hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the. specimen measuring up to 1.5 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to. reveal an ulcerated mass lesion measuring 1.1 cm in length and 0.7 cm in. width. The mass is located 10.0 cm from the stapled margin and 6.3 cm from. the open margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the submucosa. The. depth of invasion is 0.4 cm grossly. They is a 0.1 cm polyp located 3.0 cm. from the open resection margin. There are several diverticuli with. associated muscular wall and pericolic adipose tissue thickening. The. remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable. The attached adipose tissue is. thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections. and for TPS. Summary of sections: S - stapled margin shave. o - open margin shave. T tumor, entirely. RS - 0.1 cm polyp and representative section from colon. DIV- diverticuli. LN - lymph nodes. 2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled ""Proximal margin"" and. consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 X 2.8 X 1.5 cm. At. the center of the pin, a white plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan. soft tissue is attached measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The mucosal surface is. pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and. smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and staples are. removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.
