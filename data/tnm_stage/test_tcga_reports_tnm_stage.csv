Jar 3. COMMENT. HRG. Histologic sections of the cervical tumor show that it is composed. of large nests of moderately dif.ferentiated stuamous cell. carcinoma with focal keratinisation. In some areas the neoplastic. squamous cells display prominent cytoplasmic clearing, a feature. which was appreciated on this patient's prior biopsy. The growth pattern of the tumor is almost entirely exophytic, a. feature which makes measurement of the depth of invision. difficult. However, the lesion clearly invades the cervical. stroma. The point of deepest invasion occurs at the posterior. cervix (5:00 o'clock), where the tumor invades to a depth of 5 mm. in a 20 mm thick cervix. There is no paracervical soft tissue. present on the posterior cervical wall at this point and the. serosal surface of the cervix therefore represents the margin of. resection. Thus; the most deeply invasive tumor is 15 ram from the. deep surgical resection margin. Prominent vascolar space invasion. is seen. No tumor is identified in the uterine corpus, the vagina,. or the parametrial tissues. Similarly, no tumor is identified in. the 22 regional lymph nodes examined, including two parametrial. --4--.

Bronchial carcinoma left upper lobe, attempted angioplasty upper lobe, discontinuation with central tumor in. REPORT ON FINDINGS. Macroscopy. 1.) Mediastinal squamous epithelium: 0.6 cm hard pale brownish specimen. Inflated, fixed left lung measuring. 17 x 12 cm at the base and up to 27 cm high, central bronchus resection plane located 3 cm proximal to the. bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. A staple suture line runs from the hilus in a ventrocaudal direction over. the upper and lower lobes for 7.5 cm in each case and dorsal over S2 and 6 for 6.5 cm in each case, evidently. corresponding staple suture lines. Main bronchus largely skeletonized. At the hilus four partly lesioned, mobile. blackish nodes between 0.4 and 0.8 cm. Resection margin of pulmonary artery shows high-grade lesion. Apical. and lateral region over S1, 2 and 3 shows a 16 x 14.5 cm area of parietal pleura that shows predominantly. extensive adhesion and marginally loose attachment in parts. Ostium of upper lobe bronchus constricted by a. central moderately firm, pale brown to whitish tumor, max. 4.9 cm in size, in the upper lobe, with a. predominantly relatively clear and arcuate demarcation and patchy grayish-black pigmentation in parts. Extension of tumor right up to hilar resection surface, where 1.5 cm is questionably part of the pericardial sac,. which is not macroscopically infiltrated. Involvement of some grayish-black nodes up to 1.5 cm in size by the. tumor. Narrowing of numerous blood vessels and questionable wall infiltration of an already patent pulmonary. artery branch of the upper lobe, with not tumor tissue discernible in the lumen. In S3 at the junction with S3. laterally below the section of parietal pleura is a 3.5 cm hemorrhagic zone, partly with a clear demarcation,. extending to the pleura. Peripheral bronchi of the upper lobe in parts slightly dilated and filled with thick. mucus, rest of parenchyma of the upper and lower lobes inconspicuous. From the bifurcation of the bronchus. into the basal lower lobe bronchi, three blackish nodes between 0.4 and 0.7 cm. In the subpleural region in S6 at. the junction with S8 a 0.3 cm flat blackish node. 3.) Repeat resection material from pulmonary artery: irregular portion of pulmonary artery measuring 3.7 x max. 1.3 cm. 4.) Interlobar LN (station 11): 0.7 cm lesioned node. 5.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9): 0.6 cm node with surrounding tissue. 6.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8): 0.6 cm node with surrounding tissue. 7.) Paraaortic LN (station 6): two lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 0.8 and 0.4 cm. 8.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 1 cm node with surrounding tissue. 9.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 0.4 cm node. Examined: Re 1.) Rapid section remains,.

Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. EVALUATION. Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Locally advanced, central, bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and. polymorphocellular, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung (G3). Tumor. classification according to this picture pT4 pN1 V1 RX(R1?), stage III. C34.M8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Tumor necroses. Active resorptive alveolar and lymphofollicular interstitial inflammation in the lung. parenchyma adjacent to the tumor. Lung tissue necrosis with marginal organizing and fibrous remodeling. process under the pleural adhesion area in S1. Fresh hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction in the boundary region. of S1/S3. Fibrinous pleuritis and pleural adhesions. Moderate anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung. parenchyma and varying degrees of partly mixed dust pigment deposits in the lymph nodes with reactive. accumulation of macrophages. Remark/addendum: The carcinoma shows partially endobronchial growth as far as the ostium of the upper lobe, continuously. metastasized to local bronchopulmonary lymph nodes with invasion via the mediastinal pleura into the. mediastinum, where it reaches the resection plane in places. This finding explains the pT4 classification,. although the evidently co-resected layer of parietal pericardium is not reached or infiltrated by the tumor. The. precondition is thus also met for the R1 category. If this area is directly followed by the preparation registered. under 1.), which is likewise marginally occupied by tumor, a category of R0 may also be diagnosed. Large. pulmonary vessels are only surrounded, but not invaded by tumor. The resection margins of the main bronchus,. the large pulmonary vessels, the lower lobe of the lung and all other lymph nodes are tumor-free.",T4,N1,M0,T4N1M0

This section has been reviewed and approved by the. nn. Staging. Staging is a way of describing a cancer, such as where it is located, if or where it has spread, and if it. is affecting the functions of other organs in the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to determine the. cancer's stage, so staging may not be complete until all the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps. the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient's prognosis (chance. of recovery). There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancers. There is no standard system for staging thymoma; however, the most commonly used system is called. the Masaoka system. This system was developed in. and it classifies thymoma into the following. stages: Stage I: The cancer is limited to the thymus and the capsule that surrounds it. Stage II: The cancer has spread into fat surrounding the thymus or into the lining of the lung next to. the tumor, called the mediastinal pleura. Stage III: The cancer has spread to other organs that are near the thymus, such as the lung, blood. vessels, and the sac around the heart, called the pericardium. Stage IVA: The cancer has spread more extensively into the lining of the lung or the sac around the. heart. Stage IVB: The cancer has spread to organs further away from the thymus, or has spread through the. vessels carrying blood or lymph. Classification. In addition to its stage, thymoma can be classified into different categories, developed by the. ), based on what the tumor cells look like under a microscope: Type A thymoma. This is also called spindle cell thymoma or medullary thymoma. The chance of. recovery for people with type A thymoma is good, with a. survival rate (percentage of. people who survive at least. after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other. diseases) near. TypeAB thymoma. Also called mixed thymoma, type AB thymoma is similar to type A thymoma;. however, type AB thymoma has lymphocytes in the tumor. The chance of recovery for people with. type AB thymoma is also good, with a. survival rate of approximately. %. Type B1 thymoma. This is also known as lymphocyte-rich thymoma, lymphocytic thymoma,. predominantly cortical thymoma, and organoid thymoma. This type of thymoma has very many. lymphocytes in the tumor, but the cells of the thymus appear normal. The chance of recovery for. people with type B1 thymoma is also good, with a 20-year relative survival rate (percentage of people. who survive at least. years after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other. diseases) of approximately. Type B2 thymoma. Type B2 thymoma also has many lymphocytes, like type B1 thymoma; however,. the thymus cells do not appear normal. Type B2 thymoma is also known as cortical thymoma and. polygonal cell thymoma. The. Fyear relative survival rate for people with type B2 thymoma is. approximately. Type B3 thymoma. Type B3 thymoma is also known as epithelial thymoma, atypical thymoma,. squamoid thymoma, and well-differentiated thymic carcinoma. This type of thymoma has few. lymphocytes, and the thymus cells look abnormal. The. survival rate is approximately. Thymic carcinoma. Thymic carcinoma, previously called type C thymoma, is very rare and more. aggressive. Thymic carcinoma cells do not look like normal thymus cells, but like cancers in other. organs of the body. This type of tumor is often advanced when diagnosed. It is classified into two. categories: low grade, which has a better chance of recovery, and high grade, which is more likely to. grow and spread quickly. Low-grade thymic carcinoma includes basaloid, mucoepidermoid, and well-. differentiated squamous cell types. High-grade thymic carcinoma includes anaplastic/undifferentiated. clear cell, poorly differentiated squamous cell, sarcomatoid, and small cell/neuroendocrine types. The. five-year relative survival rate of people with thymic carcinoma is. rate of people with thymic carcinoma is. %. Cancer survival statistics should be interpreted with caution. These estimates are based on data from. thousands of cases of this type of cancer in the United States, but the actual risk for a particular. individual may differ. It is not possible to tell a person how long he or she will live with thymoma. < Previous. Next >.",T2,N1,M0,T2N1M0

The first specimen is labelled `left lower lobe' and consists of a lobe of. lung measuring 125 x 80 x 65 mm. No parietal pleura is included. The visceral. pleural surface shows focal puckering of the lateral surface. The area of. puckering measures 25 mm in diameter. Several enlarged hilar nodes are. identified. They measure between 15 mm and 30 mm in diameter. Serial slicing. shows a solitary, ill-defined subpleural tumour measuring 24 x 10 x 22 mm. It. is located immediately beneath the area of pleural puckering, and is 33 mm from. the bronchial resection margin. The non-neoplastic lung shows extensive. dilatation of the subpleural airspaces toward the apex. Some of the dilated. airspaces measure up to 35 mm in maximum diameter. Toward the base, there is. diffuse firmness of the lung parenchyma, which is associated with grey. discolouration.

HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

""Left breast biopsy (AF1)"". in formalin. The specimen consists of an. irregular ovoid fragment of firm pink and yellow-tan tissue measuring 2 x 1.5. x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. A portion of the specimen has been previously. submitted as frozen section AF1, and portion of tissue has been previously. submitted for ER/PR evaluation. The frozen section remnant is submitted in. Block A1 and the remaining tissue is sectioned and submitted in Block A2. B. ""Left breast"", fresh. The specimen is a 500 gram, 35.5 x 16 x 5.5 cm in. aggregate dimension less mastectomy specimen and attached axillary dissection. The breast measures approximately 24 x 15.5 x 5.5 cm. The skin ellipse is 18.7. x 10.4 cm. The nipple is slightly atypical located on the skin surface away. from the axillary tail. The nipple is 1.4 cm in diameter and is slightly. depressed and surrounding areola is 4 cm in diameter. The tip of skin ellipse. closes to the axillary dissection (upper outer quadrant) exhibit a recent. sutured skin excision which is 4.5 cm long and is 2.7 cm from the superior. upper outer surgical margin. The skin also exhibit three small purple-brown. circumscribed lesion measuring from 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. scattered in several areas over the surface. The surgical margin are marked. with blue ink. The deep surface opposite the previously described suture. excision on the skin surface exhibits a focal area of suture material which. closes a 2.1 cm defect in the deep surface. This defect communicates with the. biopsy cavity. The margin in this area is inked carefully. Sectioning reveals. the biopsy cavity is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and. is hemorrhagic. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is a firm, poorly demarcated. tan, slightly gritty mass which is 6.2 x approximately 4 x 2.7 cm in greatest. dimension. This is well demarcated from the surrounding adipose tissue in the. outer quadrant, however, but extends toward the center of the specimen it. becomes less easily demarcated. The breast tissue of the remainder of the. specimen is firm, fibrotic with multiple cystic structures measuring up to. 1. cm in greatest dimension and filled with gray-green fluid is a second. relatively circumscribed area of soft pink-tan tissue which bulges above the. cut surfaces and measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. This is. located more centrally but in the lower outer quadrant. The larger firm mass. surrounding the biopsy cavity to within approximately 0.5 cm of the surgical. margin but the fibroadipose tissue on the deep surface is easily clear over. the lesions. Tumor extends to within 1.5 cm of the superior surgical margin. BLOCK SUMMARY: B1-B2- representative sections of mass and adjacent biopsy cavity. B3-B5- representative sections of tumor and adjacent deep surgical margin. B6-B7- representative sections of superior surgical margin closest to tumor. B8- - representative section of nipple.

Other: Focal pulmonary infarcts. MMENT. 6. Sections of specimen 6 show soft tissue with rare small clusters of. tumour cells. One such cluster demonstrates probable perineural invasion. 8. Sections show two separate tumors composed of poorly differentiated. carcinoma with focal suggestion of squamous differentiation. The larger. tumor is found superiorly in the lower lobe. This tumor invades and. puckers the overlying pleura, but chest wall invasion and invasion into. the upper lobe are not identified. However, a second tumor is identified. more centrally in the upper lobe. This is separate from the RLL tumor,. measures 3 cm in greatest dimension, and shows similar histology to that. of the RLL tumor. The tumor demonstrates extensive vascular invasion,. including invasion of some larger vessels, and several pulmonary infarcts. are noted in the upper lobe. Multiple peribronchial lymph nodes are. involved by tumor, including by direct invasion of the RUL tumor. By. immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells show strong cytoplasmic staining. for. 5/6, focal moderate staining for high and low molecular weight. cytokeratin, and moderate to strong nuclear staining for p63. The tumor. cells are negative for cytokeratin 7 and 20, and TTF-1. The morphological. and immunohistochemical features are consistent with poorly. differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Given the morphologic. similarities between the RUL and RLL tumors and the extent of vascular. invasion, the RUL tumor is strongly favored to represent a metastasis. from the RLL tumor. The pathologic stage is therefore assessed to be. pT2N1M1. 3 of 10. CLINICAL HISTORY. LUNG CA. GROSS DESCRIPTION. 1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as ""Lymph-Node: ST9.

The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as ""LUNG: right lung. bronchial resection with ribs 4 & 5/QS"". The specimen is received fresh. and subsequently placed in to 10% buffered formalin. It consists of a. right lung: upper, middle and lower lobes, with overall dimensions of. -1.0 cm SI x 21.0 cm ML x 7.5 cm AP. A small portion of unremarkable 4th. .d 5th ribs are identified on the upper lobe, measuring 5.0 x 1.4 x 0.7. cm and 7.4 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm. The pleural surfaces of all three lobes are. homogéneously purple and congested, showing diffuse black pigmentation. Cross sections of the right upper lobe reveal three separate, poorly. defined lesions. The largest measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.3 cm, located within. the ?anterior segment. The cut surface of this lesion is homogeneously. white and firm. Further sections.show gross invasion into the bronchus. and adjacent lymph nodes. This tumor is located ""1.5 cm from the. bronchial resection margin, and 0.6 cm from the closest pleural surface. The two smaller lesions are located 2.0 cm beneath the ribs, within the. anterior aspect. Both lesions are homogeneously tan, solid and grossly. appear to have a red hemorrhagic center measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm and. 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The distance between the two smaller lesions is 0.6. cm. Both lesions are located ""5.0 Cm from the bronchial resection margin. and 1.1 cm from the closest pleural surface. The remaining parenchyma of. the right upper lobe is homogeneously dark brown and unremarkable. Cross sections of the right middle lobe are homogeneously dark brown,. spongy and unremarkable. Within the superior segment of the right lower lobe, a well-circumscribed. tumor is noted measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 4.4 cm. The cut surface of the. tumor is homogeneously white and firm; located 5.5 cm from the bronchial. resection margin. Cross sections of the tumor show that it abuts the. pleural surface, causing ""pleural puckering"". Further sections reveal. gross invasion into the pleura. Approximately 1.5 cm from the larger. mor, a smaller calcified nodule is noted (within the base of the right. lower lobe) measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The remaining parenchyma of.

Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not. indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical. Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

TCGA-55-5899,"FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: Lung, right upper lobe, biopsies: Adenocarcinoma - see comment. COMMENTS: Histologic sections show an invasive carcinoma consisting. primarily of sheets of cells with scattered, discrete. glandular structures. The neoplastic cells have prominent. nucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small. cell carcinoma, grade Il neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical. carcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm. stains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as for TTF-1. The neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight. keratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of. adenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for. synaptophysin. It is felt in that this is an example of. non-neuroendocrine carcinoma (adenocarcinoma) that shows. positive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not. result in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of. EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to. help select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be. significantly associated with response to TKIs and KRAS. mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are. mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show. that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in. adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to. TKIs and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the. ALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation. analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene. rearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer. Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on. paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic. tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are. available on request as a panel or as individual assays. This case has been reviewed by. who agree with the diagnosis. FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: Bronchus,right, washing: Negative for malignant cells. Respiratory epithelial cells, squamous cells and macrophages. are present. COMMENTS: CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a. with a right upper lobe. lung mass. CODES: 88112. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A.

External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO. and. CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force.

NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information. available at the time of this report and is subject to change. pending clinical review and additional information. Comment: The frozen section diagnosis for specimen A is confirmed. H & E stained sections show a poorly differentiated neoplasm with. vast areas of solid growth and focal glandular differentiation. Immunostains are performed on block C8. The malignant cells are. positive for AE1/AE3 and OSCAR (pancytokeratin stains). CK7 shows. focal positive staining within the malignant cells. CK20, TTF-1,. CDX-2, CD56, chromogranin, and synaptophysin are negative. A mucicarmine stain is negative. Given the tumor location and. absence of known disease outside of the liver, these findings most. likely represent a poorly differentiated intrahepatic. cholangiocarcinoma. Other primary adenocarcinomas with CK7 staining. include lung, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, small bowel, and. gallbladder. Correlation with the clinical and radiologic findings. is suggested.

CLINICAL : Malignant mesothelioma left pleura. MACROSCOPIC: An irregular strip of pleura 130 X 120 X 2mm. The surface is studded by several. irregular firm nodules measuring up to 10mm in diameter. Also submitted are. three separate strips of fibrous tissue the largest 30 x 10mm and the smallest. 20 X 10mm. BLOCK KEY: 1-6:Largest pleural fragment, :Sections from smaller pleural fragments. MICROSCOPIC: The sections show strips of pleura composed of fibrous connective tissue and. adipose tissue. Both tissue components show infiltration by a malignant. mesothelioma. Most of the tumour is of epithelioid type, being composed of. neoplastic. epithelial cells displaying tubulopapillary architecture and forming. irregular nodules. The neoplastic cells have large irregular nuclei with fine. chromatin,. prominent nucleoli and moderate to abundant amounts of eosinophilic. cytoplasm with often distinct cellular boundaries. There is moderate nuclear. pleomorphism. Apoptotic cells are present and mitotic figures are easily. identified. Focally the neoplasm is less cellular and displays increased amounts of fibrous. connective tissue. The constitutive cells in these areas are spindled in shape. and constitute the sarcomatoid component. Elsewhere the neoplastic cells are. separated by varying amounts of myxoid-appearing stroma. Interspersed are occasional nodular areas containing birefringent inorganic. material in keeping with tale particles. In association are epithelioid. histiocytes and occasional multinucleated foreign body-type giant cells. At the. periphery of the tumour is a moderately dense chronic inflammatory cell. infiltrate consisting predominantly of lymphocytes. There is accompanying. lymphoid aggregate formation. Some of the tissue strips show paucicellular areas composed of dense collagen,. most likely representing part of a pleural plaque. A single section shows blood. clot containing aggregates of neoplastic mesothelial cells. The PAS reaction with diastase digestion for mucin is negative. The Alcian blue. stain is positive in the areas of myxoid stroma. Immunohistochemistry: The epithelioid malignant cells are positive for cytokeratin 5/6, calretinin and. WT-1 and show strong peripheral membranous staining for EMA. The sarcomatoid. malignant cells are positive for calretinin and negative for CK5/6 and WT-1 and. show patchy cytoplasmic and membranous staining for EMA. Staining for BerEP4. and CEA is negative.

EGFR amplification IDENTIFIED (see In Situ Procedure). Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history. of. smoking (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of. s and up to 40% in the. population, common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable. clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small. cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sample Preparation and Gene Sequencing Analysis. For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, manual microdissection was. performed. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor calls in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using. standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of mutation, DNA was amplified with primers for the. KRAS gene and exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. Then. forward and reverse sequencing was performed using the. on. AB/3130. ). The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations with Mutation Surveyor V3.07. For. specimens with low quality and quantity of DNA, an alternative method (real-time PCR on LightCycler (Roche)) was applied for detection of KRAS. mutations. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: In Situ Procedure. Interpretation. PROBE: Vysis LSI EGFR SpectrumOrange/ CEP 7 SpectrumGreer TM Probe. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 2.65 indicating EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 25.8%, and the monosomy rate was 36.4% in the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the. EGFR gene was 5.7. 66 cells were analyzed In the targeted region. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2,0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification.

ADDENDUM # 1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: EGFR, KRAS and ALK (FISH) was sent on. 1. for patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1C appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. 1 H& E and 9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary electrophoresis. and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may. occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic. heterogeneity of the tissue sample. DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under the. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of.

This. particular test is not considered a stand alone test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS. Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under. the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. (CLIA) as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand along test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Addendum #3 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH). Body Site: Left upper lobe of Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. INTERPRETATION: Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene. Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %. Control values. 2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0. A total of 100 cells were scored. FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections. using dual color break-apart probe. to the ALK. gene at 2p23. This probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement. involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two. probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In. this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei. scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are. within the normal limits. COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of. cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals. represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes. 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in. NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in. lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (. ISCN RESULTS: nuc ish(ALKx3 4) [42/100].

FINDINGS: There is a noncalcified soft tissue mass density in the left lower lobe series 3 image #44 measured at 2.2. x 1.3 cm. This is of concern for neoplasm. There are bilateral apical opacities right greater than left. There is. posterolateral. pleural based density bilaterally right greater than left. This may be due to scarring. Mass or infiltrate. cannot be excluded and follow-up is advised. The lungs appear hyperexpanded with peribronchial thickening and. prominence of the interstitial markings. There are other regions in the right upper lobe with interstitial. density. suggesting. scarring. There is a posterior pleural based density as seen on image #25. There may be a nodular density. in the right upper lobe on image #30 versus scarring measuring 7 mm. There is a very small nodular density lateral. portion. right. upper lobe on image #33. There is no evidence of pleural fluid. There are degenerative changes in the. spine. There is vascular calcification. There are a few nodes in the mediastinum. There is a pretracheal node. measuring 1.8 X 0.8 cm. There are a few smaller nodes at the AP window. Evaluation of the hila is somewhat limited. without contrast. There is váscular calcification including coronary involvement. Adrenal glands appear mildly. thickened without definite mass. IMPRESSION: 1. There is a noncalcified mass density of concern for a neoplasm in the left lower lobe posteriorly. 2. There are bilateral apical opacities right greater than left which may be due to scarring. In light of asymmetry a. superimposed mass cannot be excluded. PET scan may be helpful to evaluate the various abnormalities.

TCGA-77-A5G8,"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. Mass removed (lobectomy). ?Malignant. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled 'right upper lobe plus ribs' and consists of a. right upper lobe measuring 180 x 105 x 45 mm. There is a vertical stapled line. rsuperior to the hilum measuring 80 mm in length. Over the apex there are two. attached short segments of ribs. Rib 1 is relatively closely adhered over the. pleural surface and measures 55 x 30 x 28 mm. This rib is cut towards one end,. 22 mm from the true resection margin. Rib 2 loosely hangs from a fibrous. fragment and measures 55 x 28 x 18 mm. Over the posterolateral aspect of the. lung is a small segment of adherent parietal pleura measuring 30 x 25 mm. Within the apex, underlying the ribs is a firm white lesion measuring 25 x 25 x. 23 mm. The mass shows focal central necrosis. The tumour is well clear of the. hilar resection margin. The apical rib is removed and the underlying pleural. surface is inked black. The true pleural margin is inked blue. The tumour. appears to invade the pleura within this region, but does not extend into the. overlying soft tissue. The remainder of the lung parenchyma shows severe. emphysema with bullae in the apical aspect surrounding the tumour. No other. focal lesions are seen or felt throughout the lobe.

Please note that sections from the ribs in specimen 1 and 3 to follow. MICROSCOPIC. 1. Sections show a peripheral moderatery-differentiated squamous cell. carcinoma. There is pronounced desmoplasia and a central area of necrosis in. association with the tumour. There is obliteration of the pleural space. overlying the tumour due to adhesions and desmoplasia. It is difficult to. interpret the layers but there is clear invasion through pleura and into chest. wall. The involved fat appears to represent lipomatous metaplasia of pleura. Printed : Histopathology Report. rather than chest wall fat. Tumour does not extend as far as the muscle or. bone and therefore the chest wall margin appears clear. The bronchial. resection margin shows no evidence of in situ or invasive malignancy. No. lymphatic, vascular or perineural invasion is seen. The sampled lymph nodes. show sinus histiocytosis with moderate amounts of carbon pigment and no. evidence of metastatic carcinoma. The surrounding lung parenchyma shows focal. lipoid pneumonia and emphysema. Collections of smokers macrophages are. present. COMMENT. No sections of the ribs have been examined at this stage as the tissue is still. being decalcified. Sections of the ribs will be examined in due course and a. final report issued. 2.

TCGA-78-7153,"HISTORY. Large right upper lobe tumour. MACROSCOPIC. Six specimens received: 1: The specimen is labelled ""middle and upper right lobe"" and comprises right upper and middle lobe,. received fresh, and measuring 160 X 60 X 60 mm. There is a marked degree of pleural puckering and. indrawing over the postero-lateral surface of the upper lobe. The pleura overlying the middle lobe. appears normal. A stapled margin, 65 mm in length, is present above the hilum. The bronchial. resection margins and vascular resection margins show no evidence of tumour. Peribronchial lymph. nodes are black and soft. Transverse slicing reveals a somewhat ill-defined tumour mass, 47 mm. in. diameter, within the postero-lateral aspect of the upper lobe extending almost to the pleural surface and. extending to within 10 mm of the bronchial resection margin. The surrounding lung parenchyma. appears consolidated and yellowish in colour. The main tumour mass is pale grey to cream in colour. with focal carbon pigmentation. The remainder of the lung parenchyma shows no pathological. features. Towards the apex of the upper lobe there is a second contiguous lobulated tumour mass, 30. mm in diameter, which also appears clear of the pleura. This has a more tan cut surface.

[BIT, 2A]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""pulmonary vein lymph node No. 2"" and comprises fragments of. anthracotic soft tissue, 20 X 10 X 5 mm in aggregate. [BIT, 3A]. 4: The specimen is labelled ""No. 10 lymph node"" and comprises two fragments of soft anthracotic. tissue, the first 5 mm in greatest diameter, and the second 15 X 15 X 7 mm. [BIT, the larger fragment. after bisection, 4A]. 5: The specimen is labelled ""right middle lobe lymph node"" and comprises an irregular fragment of. soft anthracotic tissue, 20 X 8 X 5 mm. [BIT, 5A]. 6: The specimen is labelled ""No. 4 lymph node"" and comprises a lymph node with surrounding fat,. overall size 20 X 15 X 8 mm. The lymph node is 12 X 8 X 5 mm. [BIT after bisection, 6A]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma has areas of mucinous. and papillary differentiation. The contiguous nodule has a similar appearance and it is considered that. these represent part of the same tumour. The main lesion is invading into an area of subpleural. elastotic scarring. Although no convincing pleural invasion is identified within the sections, special. stains will be performed. The other component also abuts the pleura but there is no pleural invasion. Blood vessel invasion is present but no lymphatic or perineural permeation is seen. The mass is well. clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is squamous metaplasia with severe dysplasia at the. middle lobe bronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung. shows no specific abnormality. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph node fragments show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of. malignancy. 4: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 6: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes only.

Part # 1, # 2, # 3, # 4, and # 5: The results of immunohistochernical stainings support the. above diagnosis (see microscopic description). Parts #1, #2 and #3: The metastatic tumor cells with thin these lymph nodes are depicted. by the AE1/AE3 cytokeratin immunostaining and are present circumferentially within the. sub capsular sinusoidal area in minute tumor cell clusters and mostly as single cells. Re-. review of the imprint slides performed at intraoperative consultation showed no metastatic. tumor cells in part 1 and part 2, and showed rare atypical cells in part 3. GROSS DESCRIPTION. The specimen is received fresh and in 5 parts. Part 1 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #1 left axilla,. not blue"". It consists of a portion of. adipose tissue which measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch. preparation to reveal a homogenous tan-yellow cut surface. The lymph node is further. bisected longitudinally into 2-mm intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled. 1A-1B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 2 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #2 left axilla. not blue"". It consists of a single fatty pink. tan. probable lymph node with minimal attached adipose tissue which measures 2 x 1.7 x. 1. cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch preparation analysis to reveal a largely fatty. replaced cut surface. The lymph node halves are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal. intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled 2A-2B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 3 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #3 left axilla not blue"". It consists of a portion of. adipose tissue which measures 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm. A single fatty pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected to reveal a largely. fatty replaced cut surface. One half the lymph node is submitted for frozen section. analysis. Both halves of the lymph node are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal. intervals and submitted entirely as follows: 3FS- lymph node half, frozen section. 3A- remaining lymph node halves. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""sentinel node biopsy #4 left axilla. not blue"". It consists of a portion of adipose tissue which measures 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node is identified measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm. The. lymph node is bisected to reveal a pink-tan cut surface interspersed with adipose tissue. The lymph node halves are further sectioned into 2-mm longitudinal intervals and submitted. entirely in two cassettes labeled 4A-4B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours. Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials. and ""left total mastectomy long lateral. short superior"". It consists of a 1202 g total mastectomy specimen which measures 23.5 x. 22 x 7.5 cm. The anterior surface is remarkable for an ellipse shaped portion of light tan. skin which measures 20 x 16 cm. The areola measures 6.5 x 6 cm with a 1.1-cm. retracted, mobile nipple. No discrete skin scars or lesions are grossly identified. The. specimen is inked and sectioned to reveal a large, ill-defined slightly stellate mass (ring-. shaped biopsy clip) which is located roughly between the upper outer and lower outer. quadrants, and extends towards the central aspect of the breast. The mass measures 8.0. x. 6.5 x 4.2 cm and comes to within 1.0 cm of the closest posterior margin, 2.2 cm of the. skin and 3 cm of the anterior inked margin. The breast parenchyma directly medial of the. mass and encompassing a large portion of the upper inner and lower inner quadrants is. dense and extensively fibrocystic (approximately 10 x 4.5 x 4 cm). No additional masses. are identified grossly. The uninvolved breast parenchyma is composed of approximately. 50% adipose tissue and 50% nodular fibrous tissue. Representative sections are. submitted as follows: 5A- nipple and subareolar soft tissue. 5B- breast parenchyma directly lateral of mass. 5C- fullface mass (most lateral aspect). 5D-5K-fullface mass (central lateral aspect), 5D-5G= posterior aspect, 5E-5K= anterior. aspect. 5L-5S- fullface mass (central medial aspect), 5L-50= posterior aspect, 5P-5S= anterior. aspect. 5T-5U- fullface mass (most medial aspect). 5V- breast parenchyma directly medial of mass. 5W-5Y fibrocystic tissue adjacent to the mass. 5Z-5AA- posterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AB- anterior inked margin closest to mass. 5AC- lower outer quadrant. 5AD- lower inner quadrant. 5AE- upper inner quadrant. 5AF-upper outer quadrant.

If a rearrangement. involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two. probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In. this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei. scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are. within the normal limits. COMMENTS: Three copies of ALK were observed in 32.0% of cells. This. gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals represents an. aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK. region.

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. The test is to be performed on. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 2C appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. vhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addenaum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 90% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: 1. Azzoli CG, et al.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of. the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Note: DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid. carcinomas (1). BRAF V600E. 1 mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary. carcinoma (2,3). The association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been. observed in papillary microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in -70% of. follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the. specificity of these mutations for cancer, BRAF V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are. overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they have been reported with a very low frequency in benign. thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid tumors, being found in ~40-50% of follicular. and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papillary carcinomas (6). 1.

Sample Preparation and Procedure. For. paraffin-embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of. tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on. the. atform to amplify BRAF, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting curve. analysis. was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on. DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was. considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal DNA. and RNA. Notifiable. Addendum. Molecular Anatomic Pathology Testing: Block D: A. Loss of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosome 22q. B. Fractional Allelic Loss is 9% (1 locus with loss / 11 informative loci). C. LOH at the VHL gene locus (3p.26) is NOT identified. Note: Loss of tumor suppressor gene alleles is known to occur in thyroid follicular neoplasias and to correlate with tumor progression. As. reported in the literature, widely invasive carcinomas and anaplastic carcinomas frequently have a mean fractional allele loss of. -50% (1). Adenomas typically have lower frequency of LOH, frequently fewer than 10%. Minimally invasive and angioinvasive. follicular carcinomas typically have intermediate results (1,2). Some studies have shown that LOH at the VHL gene locus is. specific for malignancy and is associated with poor prognosis (2,3). However, not all tumors reveal such a correlation and,. therefore, the LOH profile should be interpreted in the context of the cytologic and histologic findings and the patient's clinical. history. Sample Preparation and LOH Analysis. For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, manual. microdissection. was. performed to include neoplastic tissue and normal adjacent tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in a microdissection target. are accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. Fourteen microsatellite markers (listed below) that have been previously found to be involved in thyroid neoplasia and co-localize with known tumor. suppressor genes were used for analysis. PCR was performed using fluorescently labeled primers and the products of amplification were detected. using capillary electrophoresis on ABI3730 platform. Relative fluorescence was determined for individual alleles and the ratio of peaks was. calculated (GeneMappper ABI 3730). Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the patient is heterozygous at the marker (genetically. informative) and neoplastic tissue was then analyzed to detect loss of heterozygosity. Thresholds for significant allelic imbalance were determined. using normal (non-neoplastic) specimens for every marker. Loss of heterozygosity was determined using formula and reported. when allelic ratio for a particular marker was below 0.5 or above 2.0. When normal tissue was not available, peak height ratios falling outside of 2. SDs beyond the mean for each polymorphic allele paring were assessed as showing loss of heterozygosity.

D) SOURCE: Lung, right lower lobe with en bloc chest wall resection. Received fresh labeled ""right lower lobe with en bloc chest wall resection"". consists of a right lower lobe measuring 18 X 10 X 5.8 cm with attached. ribs 8, 9, and 10 anteriorly. The anterior soft tissue of the chest wall. resection is inked orange, the anterior margins of the bone green, and. posterior bone margins red. Beneath the ribs is a palpable lesion extending. to the pleural surface, in both the anterior and posterior aspects. The. pleura overlying this mass is inked black. The resection margin displays. tan-pink tumor at the margin but not attached to the bronchus. The. bronchial margin is taken en face and submitted on chuck 1 for frozen. section diagnosis. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ""Bronchial. margin negative"" is rendered by. A tan-pink 1 cm lymph node is found and is considered level 12 per surgeon. One additional'0.9 cm lymph node is found at the hilum. The tumor is. sectioned from posterior to anterior revealing a mostly well-circumscribed. focally necrotic tumor mass measuring 5 X 4 X 3.8 cm. The tumor appears to. attach to the posterior soft tissue of the intercostal muscle but does not. appear to invade into the bone. The tumor is 2 cm from the nearest bony. resection margin which is the anterior aspect of rib 9. It extends to the. pleural surface both anterior and posteriorly but does not extend through. it. The anterior ribs and soft tissue are removed and the subsequent. underlying tissue of both the ribs and the tumor are inked yellow. It. appears that the tumor is firmly adherent to rib 9 and the intercostal soft. tissue between ribs 8-9 and 9-10. The ribs 8 and 10 appear to be detached. from the tumor. The anterior chest wall resection is removed from the lung. and each aspect has been inked yellow. The anterior and posterior bone. margins of the ribs are taken en face. Sections are taken of the bone at. number 9 where the tumor was attached most firmly revealing the tumor to. extend through the parietal pleura and does not appear to invade the. periosteum of the bone in rib number 9. Tumor does not appear to be within. the soft tissue proper of the intercostal soft tissue. There is a dense. desmoplastic 1 cm rind focally at the tumor, rib number 9 junction. The remainder of the parenchyma is tan-pink and spongy with moderate. anthracosis. No additional satellite lesions are seen. Note that tissue is. taken for possible ancillary studies. Note: A photograph is taken. Representative sections are submitted in 22 cassettes labeled: 1. Frozen section bronchial resection margin. 2. Level 12 lymph node sectioned. 3.

The specimen is received with an accompanying radiogram which shows a needle coursing from the. medial aspect to the lateral aspect. The needle is a stellate area of increased density and a surgical. clip is present. The specimen has been oriented in surgery with short designating superior long lateral. and looped anterior. Specimen is inked as follows: inferior-orange, superior-red, lateral-yellow,. anterior-blue, medial-green and posterior black. Specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior. and in the inferior aspect of the specimen is an irregularly shaped firm pink-tan mass measuring. 3.7x3.5x1.5cm. Areas of hemorrhage are seen. The mass is within 1. 1cm from the lateral margin,. 1.2cm from the anterior margin, 2.2cm from the medial margin, 1.7cm from the deep margin, 1.7cm. from the inferior margin and approximately 4.4cm from the superior margin.

COMMENT: Review of the original touch prep, for sentinel lymph node #2, shows a single minute focus of metastatic. tumor cells. The metastatic deposit in sentinel lymph node #2 measures 4mm in greatest diameter, and. shows approximately 1mm of extracapsular extension focally. Gross examination of the left breast wide. local excision shows an irregularly shaped 3.7x3.5x1.5cm lesion, which is grossly away from the. margins of excision. On gross examination, there is a separate firm nodule which measures 0.7cm in. diameter which is near the larger tumor mass. Examination of microscopic sections, in the intervening. breast between these two nodules, however shows continuity of the 2nd smaller nodule with the larger. mass, consistent with an irregular, dumbbell shaped single lesion.

COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by Dakc. bllowing the manufacturer s instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: E10. Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 15%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. C. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the. int recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17. centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E10. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.03. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section. diagnosis 1, and subsequently submitted in cassette A1. Part B, labeled ""non-sentinel lymph node #2 right axilla,"" consists of a single soft, irregular, red-tan. candidate lymph node measuring 1.3 X 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section. diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in cassette B1. Part C, labeled. consists of a single soft,. irregular piece of red-yellow, fatty tissue measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.4 cm. Fatty tissue is trimmed away,. and a single candidate lymph node is found. The candidate fymph node is entirely submitted for. frozen section diagnosis 3, and subsequently submitted in cassette C1. The remaining unused fatty. tissue is entirely submitted in cassette C2. Part D, received in formalin and labeled. consists of one soft and firm,. tan-yellow, fatty tissue fragment measuring 1.7 x 1 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in. cassette D1. Part E, received in formalin and labeled. consists of one soft and firm,. tan-yellow, fatty tissue fragment measuring 1.6 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in. cassette E1. Part F is received in formalin and additionally labeled. It consists of a 9-gm. breast lumpectomy specimen, measuring 1.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 5 cm from superior to. inferior, and 3.5 cm from lateral to medial. There is a short stitch designated as superior and a long. stitch designated as lateral. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior superior blue, anterior inferior. green, and posterior black. Prior to receipt by me (Dr. the posterior portion of the. breast has been incised and tissue removed for tissue banking. The specimen is serially sectioned,. from medial to lateral, into eight slices and reveals a well-circumscribed, tan, firm nodule (1.5 x 1 x. 0.9 cm) in slices 3 through 6. The tumor nodule is located approximately 1 cm from both the lateral-. and medial-most margins, 0.7 cm from the superior margin, and 1.3 cm from the inferior margin. The. closest approach to a margin is in slice 6, where it appears to abut the anterior-mid portion of the. specimen (<1 mm grossly from the blue/green-inked margin). The specimen is entirely submitted as. follows: Cassette F1: Medial-most margin. Cassette F2: Slice 2, superior. Cassette F3: Slice 2, inferior. Cassette F4: Slice 3, superior (and nodule).

The specimen is. trimmed and extensively searched for lymph nodes. Multiple candidate lymph nodes are found and. submitted intact in cassettes G1-G5. Fee Codes: Working Draft. Addenda. Addendum. Date Complete: Addendum Comment. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block F6. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in ~50% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is weak to moderate nuclear staining in ~15%. of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block F6 using the CB11 monocional antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of Immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification.

TNM classification on the basis of this material pT2 pNO pM1 (PUL) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.2 M8255/3. Comment/supplementary remark: The tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantly. tubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate. immunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a. (hematogenous) metastasis that - despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cell. morphology in places - is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous. remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral. bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick-walled. pulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial. occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the. observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the. pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space. Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci). CK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative.

The results reported below are the. verbatim results of this referral. HER2 Amp. Breast Cancer. FISH. Specimen. Tissue-Paraffin. Specimen ID. Source. Left breast. Reason For Referral. r/o HER2 gene amplification. Fixative. Formalin. Method: FISH using probes for HER2 (17q12) and a chromosome 17 centromere (D17Z1) control probe. (PathVysion,. Two technologists score signals in 60 total nuclei from invasive or. metastatic tumor and concurrent controls. nuc ish (D17Z1x2, Her2x3-5). The HER2 to D17Z1 ratio is 2.28. Interpretation: The invasive tumor nuclei have an amplified HER2D17Z1 ratio (per ASCO/CAP. The HER2D17Z1 ratio is 2.28. In our opinion, this result may not. guidelines). reflect centromere true HER2 and amplification. 3-5 copies of Most the HER2 nuclei gene. have 2 This copies result of the indicates chromosome the. 17 tumor has. additional copies of the HER2 gene (i.e., duplication), but does not have sufficient. copies to suggest high level HER2 amplification. It is not known if HER2. duplication is associated with HER2 over-expression in breast adenocarcinoma. ASCO/CAP reporting guidelines (Wolff et al, Arch Path Lab Med 131:18-43, 2007). A HER2D17Z1 ratio less than 1.8 indicates absence of HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio from 1.8-2.2 is equivocal for HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates HER2 gene amplification.

Tumor made up to solid structures of large atypical epithelia, densely packed in parts, with copious,. mostly stained cytoplasm with the inclusion of isolated very large, otherwise often round, occasionally. deformed nuclei containing granular chromatin and always prominent nucleoli. Apoptoses, not uncommonly. several mitoses per markedly enlarged visual field (field length 0.61 mm). Occasionally a vague epidermoid. layer, often intercellular fissures and isolated visible bridges. No mucin inclusion. In places a dissociation of the. tumor cell structures. Smaller areas of necrosis. Affected lung parenchyma partly destroyed, likewise a. relatively a large bronchus here, strand of cartilage remaining. A further large bronchus partially infiltrated and. involved in the tumor, likewise in this area smaller bronchi and bronchioles whose lumen is partly dilated, the. original respiratory epithelium replaced by tumor epithelium. In adjacent region tumor cell nests and formations. of small tumor lie freely in alveoli, also tumor cell structures in dilated lymph vessels. Vascularized interlobular. septa. between the tumor formations partly loose, partly fiber-rich, collagenous connective tissue with. accumulation of inflammatory cells. Isolated small vessels here, walls thickened by elastosis and containing. tumor cells. A larger vein surrounded, loose capillary-containing fiber tissue in the lumen. Between peripheral. tumor margin and visceral pleura on the medial side a strip of free lung parenchyma with partly deficient. atelectasis and thickened alveolar septa. Lower pleural fissure and partly fused visceral pleura demarcating or. covering this fissure transcended by tumor, where large bronchi are invaded to within close proximity of the. mucosa. Large tumor node next to the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation, enclosed anthracotic pigment, tumor. cell nests here at the resection margin. In the mediastinal tissue a further tumor-compromised lymph node with. anthracotic pigment deposits and otherwise fibrous growth of connective tissue. In subpleural region of S1 a flat. remodeling zone of the lung parenchyma with development of collagenous and elastic connective tissue, with. alveolar stroma still partly recognizable. Nearby tiny radial areas of interstitial fibrosis with small patches. of. accumulated anthracotic pigment. In the basal lower lobe am relatively large area of nonoxygenated, fibrosed. lung parenchyma with inclusion of partly obliterated smaller, partly patent vessels and bronchioles. Overlying. pleura markedly enlarged and fibrotic. Otherwise here and there in dilated peripheral airways mucus and. leukocytes and also a small cluster of pigment-storing macrophages in the alveoli. At the bronchus resection. margin, sections of mucosal epithelium are interrupted, otherwise regular. Here as in the walls of the large. pulmonary vessels no evidence of tumor cells. Lymph node at the hilus with isolated secondary follicles, slight. plaque of anthracotic pigment and foci of large macrophages. Re 2.) - b.) Partly preserved lymph nodes with few secondary follicles, varying degrees of anthracotic pigment. deposits, accumulation of macrophages and isolated secondary follicles. In parts, lymph nodes are largely. occupied by solid epithelial tumor. In places, tumor manifestation also in the paranodal tissue. At one point and. in a larger lymph node only very small areas occupied by tumor cell nests. EVALUATION. Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Central bronchopulmonary, histologically largely undifferentiated, large-cell squamous cell carcinoma of the. right lower lobe of the lung (C4) with overgrowth of the interlobar fissure and continuous growth into the. adjacent section of the middle lobe and also several in some cases large lymph node metastases. Tumor. classification according to this picture pT2 pN3 L1 V1 R1, stage III. C34.3 M8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Peripheral bronchiolectasia in the lower lobe, relatively large fibrous cicatricial remodeling zone in S10. mediobasal and similar flat subpleural cicatricial zones in S1 apical. Local high-grade pleural fibrosis over S10. Tumor-associated inflammation and small tumor necroses. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung. parenchyma and relatively marked in some lymph nodes. Remark/addendum: The main mass of the carcínoma lies in S10. Centrally it has grown as far as the bifurcations of the lower lobe. main bronchus and the middle lobe bronchus, without these being destroyed or constricted. The tumor invasion. of small blood vessels only concerns the focal region, the lymphangioinvasion is more marked and is also. located in the vicinity of the tumor focus. The R1 classification is based on the finding that carcinoma nests in. the large involved lymph nodes next to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus extend to the mediastinal. resection plane. Further lymph node metastases are seen at the intermediate bronchus in the mediastinum and. also in the lymph nodes located under 4.) - 6.). The pN3 classification is also made with regard to the previous. finding with carcinoma cell structures in the fine needle aspiration biopsy from LN4 left (according to clinical. data).",T2,N3,M0,T2N3M0

Sections taken from the abnormal thickened area described. macroscopically showed diffuse pattern poorly differentiated. adenocarcinoma, which infiltrates through the full thickness of the. gastric wall, into perigastric fat. The cells are poorly cohesive. The minor component have a signet-ring pattern, but generally the. cells are pleomorphic, with variable quantitive cytoplasm. Tumour. extends to the gastro-oesophageal junction, where there is a small. nodule of gland forming tumour, beneath squamous epithelium. Intramucosal tumour is identified in this region, unlikely the. remainder of the stomach, where the tumour is predominantly. submucosal and intramural. Tumour extends close to the proximal. margin but does not involve it. Two (2) greater curve lymph nodes. were identified, both showing metastatic carcinoma.

Pathology: Provider - Permanent. Collected Date: Gross Description. Received are specimens A to B. All requisitions and specimen containers are labelled with the patient's name. The cassettes and AP identifiers are labelled with the Surgical Numbe. A. The specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin and consists of a slightly congested, non intact. gallbladder, measuring 7.0 X 3.0 X 1.5 cm. The serosal surface is smooth and glistening. Opening the gallbladder reveals. green bile and green, velvety mucosa. The gallbladder wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The cystic duct is patent. The. cystic duct lymph node is not identified. Three representative sections are submitted in one cassette. B. The specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin and consists of a portion of liver weighing 245. grams and measuring 15.0 x 5.5 x 7.5 cm. The surgical margin is inked blue. Sectioning of the liver reveals a tan,. lobulated, circumscribed mass measuring 5.5 X 4.5 X 6.5 cm. Grossly, this mass extends to the liver capsule giving the. capsule a lobulated appearance in one area. The mass comes to within 0.5 cm of the blue-painted resection margin. There is a vague nutmeg appearance to the liver parenchyma, otherwise it is unremarkable. Sections of the specimen are as follows: B1,B3. three sections through the lobulated surface on the liver capsule. B4,B5. two sections of the mass in relation to the blue-painted margin. B6,B7. two sections of the mass with adjacent unremarkable liver parenchyma. B8. a section of unremarkable liver parenchyma. Microscopic Description. A. Sections show largely unremarkable gallbladder tissue with only minor patchy chronic inflammation in the mucosa and. focal mild subserosal fibrosis. No atypia is present. B. Sections show a relatively circumscribed but invasive hepatocellular carcinoma that extends to the liver capsule, but. does not show any sign of disruption or breaching of the capsule. The carcinoma grows in sheets with cells showing. relatively abundant cytoplasm but showing variable nuclei with mild to moderate atypia, nucleoli, and patchy. hyperchromasia. Cytoplasmic intranuclear inclusions are also prominent. The tumor cell cytoplasm shows a range of. appearances, from granular eosinophilic to through to areas of clear cell change as well as areas with well developed fatty. change. In places a vague sinusoidal architecture can be seen and intra sinusoidal collections of extramedullary. hemopoiesis are present. Focal areas of hemorrhage, edematous degeneration and focal frank necrosis are present. The interface between the carcinoma and adjacent liver tissue varies, in areas having a circumscribed and almost. encapsulated margin but elsewhere having a vague merging of cancer cells with adjacent parenchyma. No evidence of. vascular invasion can be identified. Pathology: Provider - Permanent. Cunninal Anthalance Report. ₹. Collected Date: The adjacent liver parenchyma shows mild patchy chronic inflammation in portal tracts (nonspecific portal triaditis) as well. as focal mineral oil lipogranulomas in portal areas. There is no hemosiderin accumulation or other abnormal. intracytoplasmic inclusions. No evidence of significant fibrosis or background cirrhosis is present.

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA. extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed. using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent. probe amplification (MLPA) . These investigations were. performed in the. The kit P027 from. which examines for gains or. losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using. and the. quality assessed using multiplex-PCR prior to the MLPA. reaction. The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on. assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on. differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is. printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis. demonstrated: normal chromosome 1p,. disomy 3,. normal chromosome 6. and normal chromosome 8. Taken together, these molecular data would place the patient. in the low risk group with respect to the development of. metastatic melanoma.

The papillary renal cell carcinoma is composed of papillae lined by tall columnar cells. Most tumor cells have eosinophilic. cytoplasm, and some cells have clear cytoplasm. These morphologic features are consistent with type 2 papillary renal cell. carcinoma. The tumor appears to be confined to the kidney and does not show invasion into the renal sinus adipose tissue,. perinephric fat or the renal vein. The para-aortic lymph nodes (specimen B) involved by metastatic renal cell carcinoma are matted together, hence the exact. number of lymph nodes cannot be assessed. In addition to tumor in the lymph nodes there are small foci of tumor within vascular-. lymphatic spaces in the perinodal adipose tissue. GROSS DESCRIPTION. (A). LEFT KIDNEY WITH REGIONAL LYMPH NODE, VACCINE PROTOCOL - A radical nephrectomy specimen (21.0 x 15.0 x 8.5. cm) including the left kidney (12.5 x 11.0 x 7.3 cm), a segment of renal artery, the renal vein and ureter (1.4 cm in length and 0.5. cm average diameter) and the adrenal gland (5.5 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm). There is a 10.0 x 8.5 x 8.5 cm well circumscribed tumor in the lower/mid pole of the kidney. The tumor is tan-gray and friable. with focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis throughout. The tumor is well circumscribed and does not grossly invade into. perinephric adipose tissue, renal sinus, or renal vein. The tumor does not extend to Gerota's fascia. Three enlarged lymph nodes. (0.6 to 2.9 cm in greatest dimension) are identified in the hilum of the kidney. These are grossly involved by tumor. The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. Serial cross. sections of the left adrenal gland show unremarkable cortex and medulla. Tumor has been submitted for the vaccine protocol. Portions of the tumor have also been submitted for possible electron. microscopy. Photographs were obtained. INK CODE: Blue - Gerota's fascia.

Extensive, large cell, non-keratinizing, bronchopulmonary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lobe of the. right lung with poor histological differentiation, extending from central to peripheral regions, with partially. extensive necrotic changes. Tumor classification based on the existing picture pT2 pNI pMI V1 R0, stage IV. C34.1 M8070/3. G3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses. Overall still slight discontinuous interstitial fibrosis of the lung parenchyms in the mantle zone with perifocal. emphysema. Subpleural fibrous remodeled area of lung parenchyma in S7. Moderately marked mixed. pigmenting storage of dust in the lung tissue and in places high-grade (appears to be a word missing here) of. lymph nodes with inclusion of very small anisotropic particles. Marked cluster of alveolar siderophages in. places. Peritumoral accentuated slight active and partly resorptive pneumonia. Small foci of mature metaplastic. ossification of lung tissue. Diffuse and nodular zones of sclerosis in lymph nodes. Slight, focally accentuated. chronic parietal pleuritis with short sections of reactive mesothelial proliferation and likewise short sections of. slight fibrosis (sample 4.)). Remark/addendum. The carcinoma has grown centrally as ar as the main bronchus and in peripheral regions shows areas of slight. invasion of the hypocellular fibrosed visceral pleura. It is therefore not possible to decide whether the. carcinoma has arisen in the periphery of the lung or in the center of the bronchial pathway. The lymph node. metastases, like the isolated invasions of small vessels, lie wthin the tumor or the bronchopulmonaary region. Apart from the main tumor, which has penetrated focally across the transverse pleural fissure into the adjacent. section of middle lobe, a separate small tumor focus has been detected in the middle lobe. This is classified as a. satellite nodule in another lobe, although histologically it hardly shows a squamous epithelial differentiation and. contains a small light-cell solid component. A tumor-associated high-grade inflammation is also found here. The etiology of the interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which shows only minimal process activity, is histologically. unclear: there may be an association with respiratory bronchiolitis.",T2,N1,M1,T2N1M1

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patients namé, unit number,. and ""#1 - left kidney"", and consists of an 873.5 gram radical nephrectomy. specimen, measuring 23.5 x 11.5 x 7 cm in total. There is a kidney measuring. 10.5 x- 7.2 x 5 cm, an adrenal gland measuring 3.5 x 2x 1.2 cm, a ureter. measuring 8 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter, a renal artery measuring 0.8 cm. in length x 0.6 cm in diameter, and a bifurcating renal vein measuring 4.5 cm. in length, and ranging from 0.4-1.4 cm in diameter. There are grossly two. distinct masses in the renal parenchyma (T1 and T2) Mass T1 is a yellow/red,. ill-defined hemorrhagic mass measuring 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm in the lower pole. T1. extends beyond the kidney to within less than 0.2 cm of Gerota's fascia (inked. black) T1 also invades into the renal vein. The T1 tumor is found in both. segments of the vein bifurcation, completely blocking one branch. There is. also a large cortical cyst adjacent to mass T1 that measures 7 x 5.2 x 1 cm. The cyst is lined by pink, smooth tissue with multiple small white nodules. The mass T1 is located 9 cm from the ureter margin, 2 cm from the vein margin,. 4. cm from the artery margin.

ADDENDUM. RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY: DIFFUSE MESANGIAL AND FOCAL NODULAR GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MOST LIKELY. REPRESENTING EARLY DIABETIC CHANGES WITH A SUPERIMPOSED PRIMARY. VASCULAR INJURY (SEE NOTE). MODERATELY ADVANCED CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA, INCLUDING. - FOCAL GLOBAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MODERATE (25% OF. GLOMERULI AFFECTED). MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO VASCULAR DISEASE. - TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS, MODERATE (30-40% OF CORTEX). - ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS WITH HYALINOSIS, MODERATE TO. SEVERE (SEE NOTE). NOTE: The glomeruli show diffuse sclerosis of the mesangial areas with focal nodule. formation. Nodular glomerulosclerosis is most often seen in the setting of. diabetic glomerulosclerosis, although similar changes also characterize. paraprotein deposition diseases, immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, or. primary forms of vascular injury with endothelial damage and subsequent. mesangial scarring. Paraprotein and immune complex deposition diseases can be. ruled out since the immunofluorescence microscopy shows no immunoglobulin. deposits. Because the history in this patient's electronic medical record does. not include mention of diabetes mellitus, additional studies were performed on. the kidney tissue to further define the nature of the glomerular disease. Based on the results of the immunofluorescence examination, the process seen. here is most likely mediated, at least in part, by diabetes mellitus/metabolic. syndrome (or related conditions characterized by hyperglycemia and products of. glycosylation) potentially with a superimposed primary form of vascular injury. Repeated endothelial or vascular injury may be reflective of an underlying. inherited or acquired procoagulant state (e.g., idiopathic or systemic lupus. erythematosus-associated antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, thrombophilic. dysfibrinogenemia, the prothrombin G20210A mutation, the factor V Leiden. mutation, and other forms of resistance to activated protein C), a prior. pre-eclamptic gestation, autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus. erythematosus, scleroderma, overlap syndrome) a healed episode of. hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, angiotoxic. drugs, physical factors (e.g., irradiation, status post bone marrow. transplantation), malignant hypertension and, potentially, paraproteinemias or. other metabolic diseases with an important vascular component (e.g., gout,. hyperhomocysteinemia). Moderately advanced chronic changes of the kidney parenchyma are present. These changes are a result of functional adaptations to nephron loss from any. glomerular, tubular, interstitial, vascular, or mass-replacing process. While. some degree of parenchymal scarring may be due to local compression effects of. the ipsilateral masses, most of the chronic damage is likely secondary to. vascular scarring. Therefore, a similar degree of chronic damage would be. expected in the contralateral kidney. This patient, therefore, may be at risk. for persistent or progressive proteinuria and renal insufficiency. The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by Dr. Renal. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (block A12) were evaluated. using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains; an. HE-stained frozen section was also evaluated by light microscopy. The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 251 glomeruli present, of. which 54 are globally sclerosed and 8 are segmentally sclerosed. The remaining. glomeruli show expansion of the mesangial areas diffusely, with focal nodule. formation. There are no discernible craters or spikes of the glomerular. capillary wall basement membranes. Several double contours are identified. Approximately 30-40% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and. interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a moderate to severe. degree of sclerosis with hyalinosis. IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY REPORT. Sections of frozen tissue were incubated with antibodies specific for the heavy. chains of IgG, IgA, and IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C3, Clq, albumin,. and fibrin-related antigens. The sample consists of kidney cortex and medulla. There are 27 glomeruli. present, of which 11 are globally sclerosed. There is minimal granular. deposition of IgA (trace) in the mesangial areas. There is also segmental. deposition of IgM and C3 in the mesangial areas. There is diffuse linear. deposition of albumin (++/4+) and IgG (+/4+) along all basement membranes. Tubules contain reabsorbed proteins in the form of diffuse reabsorption. droplets. Tubular basement membranes reveal focal deposition of C3 (++/4+). Many casts in the distal tubules are reactive for polyclonal IgA. Arterioles. show focal C3 reactivity. There is no difference noted in the intensity of the. staining for kappa and lambda light chains in the deposits, casts, or. background of the tissue. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY REPORT. Blocks: 7. Blocks examined: 3 thick sections; 0 thin sections. Tissue submitted for electron microscopy contained no glomeruli. Thin sections. were not evaluated ultrastructurally. (Clinical history: chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine 2-3 for years),. hypertension]. Report Status : Type: Cytogenetics. Cytogeneticist: KARYOTYPE: T2;45,X, - Y(9]/46, XY [1). METAPHASES COUNTED: 10. ANALYZED: 5. SCORED 5. BANDING : GTG. INTERPRETATION: No metaphases were available from specimen labeled T1, therefore the. cytogenetic analysis could not be performed. Nine of 10 metaphases from the specimen labeled T2 contained loss of the Y. chromosome. Loss of the Y chromosome can be seen in nonneoplastic cells in. older men, and this finding is not characteristic of any particular type of. tumor. COMMENTS: Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the. standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400. bands or greater.

Comment/supplementary remark: Histologically, the large-cell and polymorphocellular solid component of the carcinoma. predominates, with a clear-cell appearance in small sections and the possibility of a. neuroendocrine differentiation (immunohistochemical analysis to follow). In all likelihood, it. is a primary peripheral carcinoma of the lung that has invaded the overlying visceral pleura to. a minimal extent and also shows central bronchopulmonary and hilar lymph node metastases. The other hilus lymph nodes and other lymph nodes removed are tumor-free. Result of immunohistochemical analysis.

Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal. may not indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all. HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy. (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A1. Source of case: RPCI. Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.11. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

B: Liver, Segment 8, excision. - Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, of intrahepatic. bile ducts (primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma), at least two. separate foci by gross examination, 0.4 and 0.8 cm. - Inked parenchymal margin (definitive margin) positive for. carcinoma (B2). - Dysplasia of the intraductal biliary epithelium and. intraductal biliary papillary carcinoma in situ, mutlifocal. C: Liver, Segments 2-5, partial hepatectomy. Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, of intrahepatic. bile ducts (primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma), at least 11.2. cm by gross measurement. - Dysplasia of the intraductal biliary epithelium and. intraductal biliary papillary carcinoma in situ, mutlifocal. - Inked parenchymal margin is extensively positive for invasive. carcinoma (C1). - Bile duct margin is positive for dysplasia (C9). Invasive carcinoma extends into perihepatic fibroadipose. tissue. - Lymphovascular space invasion is identified. - AJCC stage: pT3 pN1 (see comment). D: Lymph nodes, perihepatic, excision. - One of eleven lymph nodes positive for metastatic. adenocarcinoma (1/11). - Size of metastasis is 0.6 cm. - Extracapsular extension identified. Comment: The liver displays a spectrum of intraductal biliary neoplasia. In some bile duct profiles the epithelium is dysplastic without. papillary structure formation. In other bile duct profiles,. intraductal biliary papillomatosis is present as multifocal. papillary lesions. Intraductal papillary carcinoma is. considered to be to be the in situ lesion for the invasive. cholangiocarcinoma, and is related to the pancreatic intraductal. mucinous neoplasm. Dysplasia of the bile duct epithelium without. papillomatosis most likely is part of the same neoplastic. process in this case. The invasive tumor does not have papillary. architecture, and is a conventional gland-forming. adenocarcinoma. Invasive carcinoma is present as large mass. lesions/nodules (mass forming subtype). Extensive peri-ductal invasion (carcinoma spread along intact. biliary tree) is not identified. The tumor is staged as a. pathologic T3 because of invasion into perihepatic fibroadipose. tissue at the round ligament.

Suspected respiratory bronchiolitis. Pleural adhesion zones and. chronic fibrosing parietal pleuritis (sample 2.)). Lymph nodes with reactive follicular hyperplasia in some cases. (e.g. samples 6.), 8.) and 12.)), in some cases sinus enlargement and an overall rather minor anthracotic pigment. deposit. Remark/addendum: The main tumor mass lies in segments 3 and 2. Since the central segmental bronchi are tumor-free, it appears to. be a primarily peripheral carcinoma of the lung, which has invaded the pleura of the pleural fissure and the. adhesion zone, although at the latter site the tumor manifestation appears confined to the visceral layer. Most. lymph node metastases, some of which are rather large, are found in the hilus region.

The metastatic tumor in Part A was only present in the additionally submitted. sections of the lymph node (slide A2). Level sections on A2-A4 confirms the diagnosis. Select slides from. part C were shown at the. the faculty in attendance concurred. with the above diagnosis of micropapillary type of invasive carcinoma. Dr. has reviewed A2. and concurs with the diagnosis. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block C9. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block C9 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to. HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Slide A2 was shown at the departmental Consensus Conference, and the faculty in attendance concurred. with the above diagnosis. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

G) SOURCE: Left upper lobe bronchial margin for frozen section. Received fresh from the OR labeled ""left upper lobe bronchial margin for. frozen section and consists of a 3 g lung lobe (19 X 12 X 4 cm). The. bronchial resection margin is received stapled. The staple line is removed. and the subjacent tissue is taken en face for frozen section diagnosis. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSUL TATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ""Benign. bronchial margin"" is rendered by. The vascular margins and hilar lymph nodes are taken. The pleural surface. is tan-red to red-purple, smooth and glistening. There is a 9 cm staple. line grossly corresponding to the earlier wedge resection. The staple line. is removed and the subjacent tissue is inked blue. The staple line lies 4.5. cm from the bronchial resection margin. The lung lobe is sectioned. revealing pink-tan to red-purple spongy tissue. No discrete masses or. lesions are identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in nine cassettes as. follows: 1. Frozen section bronchial resection margin. 2. Hilar lymph nodes. 3. Vascular resection margins, en face. 4. Staple line nearest bronchial margin. 5. Additional inked staple line. 6-9. Grossly unremarkable lung parenchyma. This case is accessioned in. MICROSCOPIC. A) Sections through the wedge resection from the left upper lobe confirm. the presence of non-small cell carcinoma. The tumor is predominantly. composed of solid nests of cells with large vesicular nuclei and abundant. eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is fairly abundant and areas of. tumor necrosis are seen. The tumor is predominantly growing in solid nests. with minimal acinar formation, although occasional foci of both. intracellular and extracellular mucin are suggested. This lesion abuts but. does not appear to specifically infiltrate within the overlying visceral. pleura. Assessment in this regard includes an elastic stain on block A6. Noninvolved pulmonary parenchyma demonstrates nonspecific emphysematous. changes but is otherwise unremarkable. A limited immunohistochemical. evaluation of this lesion is performed with results as follows: TTF-1: Positive. Napsin A: Negative. Negative. P63: Limited/focal positivity is seen. The combination of TTF-1 positivity with apparent focal mucin production by. this neoplasm would confirm a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

Pagetoid spread of carcinoma is seen in benign ducts adjacent to the tumor. No such spread is seen away. from the tumor. Atypical lobular hyperplasia is present in the contralateral (right) breast. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed. on block C3. The test for estrogen receptors is positve. There is moderate nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is moderate to strong nuclear staining in 90% of. tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by. Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of o or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this. category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene. amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.

Lymph nodes, right pelvic, dissection: Negative for neoplasm, five nodes examined (0/5). C. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes, radical. hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Cervix, invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Grade III. Tumor located in endocervix with extension into lower. uterine segment. endometrial cavity and myometrium of. uterine corpus. Tumor size: 7 x 5 cm. Tumor invades completely through myometrium to involve. serosa (25 mm depth). Lymphovascular space invasion present. Surgical margins free of tumor (cervical and parametrial: no. tumor involves serosa of the uterine corpus). Endometrium, completely replaced by squamous carcinoma. Myometrium, no additional diagnoses. Right ovary, benign simple cyst. Left ovary, benign simple cyst. Bilateral fallopian tubes, no pathologic change. D. Uterine artery, biopsy: No pathologic change. Staging (AJCC 2010): pT2a2,NO (FIGO: IIA2). COMMENTS: The tumor is a poorly differentiated invasive large cell. non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, The tumor has an. unusual distribution of completely replacing the endometrium. with diffuse invasion through the myometrium to involve the. serosa of the uterine corpus. Sections including the cervix. show an unremarkable transformation zone, but squamous cell. carcinoma is present in the proximal portion of the. endocervix and lower uterine segment region. The. possibility of the squamous cell carcinoma arising in the. endometrium was considered since the tumor appears to be. centered in the uterine corpus and squamous cell carcinomas. primary of the endometrium (. on vary rare occasions. However, endocervical origin is favored since there is tumor. present in the upper portion of the endocervix. It is felt. to be more likely that the tumor originated in the. endocervix, which is much more common than endometrium, with. subsequent extension into the uterine corpus The diagnosis. of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium is. generally made only when the cervix and endocervix are free. of neoplasm.

The lower lobe measures 155 x 100 x 40 mm and the middle lobe 135 x 90 x 30 mm. There is a stapled resection margin along the middle lobe, 150 mm in length. A rounded endobronchial. tumour plug extends to the bronchial resection margin, however there is no attachment to the bronchial. wall in this region. The pleural surface appears indurated and tethered on the anterior apical part of the. lower lobe over an area approximately 25 x 30 mm.

MICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of an elastic walled artery with no evidence of. tumour. 2: Sections reveal a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the apical segment of the. right lower lobe with extensive endobronchial extension. The tumour does not invade the visceral. pleura. The bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour. Tumour extends into peribronchial. connective tissue adjacent to the resection margin but is 0.3mm clear of the peribronchial resection. margin. Within peribronchial connective tissue in this region perineural permeation by tumour is. identified. The involved nerve measures 350um in diameter and in the section examined is 1.3mm. clear of the peribronchial resection margin. Lymphatic invasion is identified. Some small blood. vessels show evidence of recanalisation, however no unequivocal vascular invasion is seen. A. peribronchial lymph node is involved by tumour, possibly by direct extension. Peribronchial lymph. nodes also show evidence of sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered. flecks of birefringent material consistent with silicate. Within adjacent lung parenchyma there is. bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging and focal endogenous lipoid pneumonia consistent with. obstructive pneumonitis. The section of right middle lobe alveolated lung parenchyma shows. bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging, however no tumour is identified. Rare mixed duct macules are. present within the remaining alveolated lung parenchyma which is otherwise unremarkable. 3: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, follicular hyperplasia,. carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent with silicate.

Specimen A is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and identified. as. ""total laryngectomy."" The specimen consists of a total laryngectomy specimen measuring 9.3 x 5.2 x 4.3 cm in total. dimension from the tip of the epiglottis to the inferior tracheal edge with attached hyoid bone measuring 9.5 x 0.5 x. 0.7 cm and the left thyroid lobe measuring 4.1 x 3.3 x 2.2 cm. The larynx is opened posteriorly on the midline at the. time of frozen section analysis. There are three tracheal rings attached. There is a tan-white appearing mass measuring 2.5 X 1.9 cm in surface area and 2.2 cm in thickness involving the. glottic larynx. The mass is grossly located on the bilateral false cord, vestibule true cord and crosses the midline. The mass does not appear to involve pyriform sinus. Grossly, the mass extends 2.4 cm from the tip of the epiglottic. mucosal edge, 2.3 cm from the base of the tongue mucosal edge, 2.4 cm from the lateral right mucosal edge, 1.1 cm. from the lateral left mucosal edge and 3.1 cm from the distal tracheal edge. None of the tracheal rings grossly. appear involved the mass. On the anterior aspect of the specimen is an ellipse of abnormal skin measuring 4.5 x 4.3. x 1.0 cm. The inferior aspect of the skin ellipse measures 2.3 cm from the distal tracheal edge. A tan-white, irregular. ulceration is identified measuring 2.2 x 1.7 cm and is present 2.5 cm from the inferior skin edge, 1.6 cm from the left. skin edge, 1.1 cm from the right skin edge and 0.9 cm from the superior skin edge. The skin defect grossly does not. appear to communicate with the mass lesion. There is a left lobe of the thyroid gland present. The cut surface is. homogenous and beefy red. A colloid nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm is noted. On sectioning, the lesion. grossly invades the anterior commissure as well as the pre-epiglottic space as well as possible full thickness invasion. of the thyroid cartilage. Sections are taken as listed in the cassette summary after decalcification. Representative. section of tumor is submitted for Tumor Bank at the time of frozen section analysis.

""Composite resection"" is received fresh and consists of a partial. mandibulectomy specimen that is 10.0 cm from anterior to posterior, 9.0. cm from superior to inferior, and 5.0 cm from medial to lateral. The. specimen contains a rectangular fragment of fibroadipose tissue (neck. dissection) which measures 12.0 X 4.0 X 1.6 cm. The specimen is inked in. the following manner: the superior surface is inked yellow, the inferior. surface is inked black, the medial surface is inked orange, the lateral. surface is inked green, the anterior surface is inked red, and the. posterior surface is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to. reveal an irregular, lobulated, firm tan-gray lesion that measures 4.2 X. 2.8 X 2.3 X cm. This lesion appears to arise from the mucosa of the. floor of the mouth and is eroding the submucosal surface down to the. mandible. The lesion grossly abuts the mandible but invasion cannot be. identified grossly. This lesion abuts the medial soft tissue margin. The. lesion appears to be 1.9 cm from the anterior margin, appears grossly to. abut the superior margin, 0.5 cm from the lateral margin, 0.6 cm from. the posterior margin, and 0.3 cm from the inferior margin.

TCGA-V4-A9EE,"Right eye enucleation. Macroscopy. The eyeball measures 25 mm of diameter before fixation, with a posterior segment of optic. nerve of 6 mm. At the section, at the lateral and posterior part of the eyeball, slightly distant. from the ciliary body, distant from the intraocular emergence of the optic nerve, a tumor is. found which is massively protruding in the vitreous cavity. It measures 16 mm main line for. 12 mm of maximum thickness and is partly cystic. The anterior chamber is free. Samples have. been made for cryopreservation and cytogenetic studies. Two samples have been made for. cryopreservation and the specimen has been then included entirely after fixation. Microscopy. The tumor seen macroscopically correspond to a malignant proliferation made nearly only. with medium or large epithelioid cells, with large eosinophilic cytoplasm sometimes loaded. with melanin pigment. The nuclei are irregular in shape and size sometimes monstrous. They. are often strongly nucleolated.A few mitotic figures are observed. The tumor proliferation,. stuck to the internal face of the sclera, infiltrates the most internal sheaths on less than one. third of its thickness.

ADDENDUM. RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY: MILD CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY, WITH: - FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (1.2% OF GLOMERULI) ;. - TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS (LESS THAN 2% OF THE. PARENCHYMA). - ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MILD. FOCAL CORTICAL SCAR, MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO CHRONIC TUMOR-RELATED. VASCULAR COMPROMISE (SEE NOTE). NOTE: The sample of tissue chosen for evaluation of the kidney shows an area of focal. cortical atrophy and scarring, most likely the result of chronic vascular. compression by the large ipsilateral tumor. Features of obstructive uropathy. are not seen at this time despite the mild degree of hydronephrosis. The. remainder of the kidney parenchyma shows minimal chronic changes, within the. expected range for. a. woman. There is minimal focal global. glomerulosclerosis (1.2% of glomeruli), minimal tubular atrophy and. interstitial fibrosis (less than 2% of the parenchyma), and a mild degree of. vascular sclerosis. The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by Dr. Renal. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A8) were evaluated. using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains. The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 333 glomeruli present, of. which 4 (1.2%) are globally sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli show no. significant expansion of the mesangial areas but are diffusely hypoperfused. There are no discernible craters or double contours of the glomerular capillary. wall basement membranes. Less than 2% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular. atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries exhibit a mild degree of. sclerosis. The kidney cortex was also evaluated in block A7 (HE) This sample comes from. an area of the kidney close to the tumor. There is prominent. and signs of hypoperfusion of glomeruli, a chronic. interstitial inflammatory infiltrate, scattered tubular distention, and mar. cortical atrophy. Overt vascular damage is not seen in the arterial vessel. included in this sample. (Clinical history: mild hydronephrosis, left renal mass). Addendum #1 by. Report Status: Final. Type: Cytogenetics.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: A17 (smaller tumor). Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 40%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A17. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.06. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone.

TCGA-78-7156,"HISTORY. ? Bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma. MACROSCOPIC. Five specimens received: 1: The first specimen which is a frozen section is labelled ""Lung Bx, frozen section' and consists of a. wedge of lung tissue with overlying visceral pleura measuring 20 X 12 x 4 mm. Serial sections taken. through specimen. No discrete lesion identified. [BIT for FS.]. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma (abuts diathermy margin). Result phoned to. [Frozen section remnants, 1A.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled with the patient's details only and consists of a left. pneumonectomy specimen. The left upper lobe measures 250 (SI) X 150 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). The left. lower lobe measures 230 (SI) x 140 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). There is an incomplete fissure on the lateral. surface of the left lower lobe. Over the lateral aspect of the pleura of the left upper lobe there is a. broad area of pallor under which the lung parenchyma is firm. This area measures approximately 140. X 110 mm. Similar subpleural firm pale areas are present throughout the lingula and are present on. both. the lateral and medial aspects of the pleura and varying in size from 3 mm up to 30 mm. At the. hilar aspect of the lung the bronchial resection margin measures 20 mm in diameter and is raised 30. mm from the surrounding tissue. A single area of pale subpleural thickening is noted in the left lower. lobe measuring 11 mm in maximum dimension. This area occurs on the anterior aspect of the left. lower lobe in the interlobar fissure. There are three areas of pleural deficiency on the left upper lobe;. one anterior and lateral measuring 30 mm in diameter and one overlying the pale area posteriorly and. superiorly measuring 30 mm in diameter where the pleura appears pulled back and is able to be laid. over the deficit. A third sutured area of pleural deficit and an underlying parenchymal defect is noted. at the postero-inferior edge of the left upper lobe laterally. This area measures 30 mm in diameter. On sectioning the lung, the majority of the left upper lobe is replaced by confluent pale tumour. measuring 165 (SI) X 120 (AP) x up to 60 mm (ML). There are numerous other deposits in the lingula. and in the most inferior aspect of the left upper lobe varying in size from 1 mm up to 20 mm. There is. extensive subpleural tumour with the large majority of the lateral aspect of the pleura appearing to be. involved by tumour. Further sectioning reveals tumour to abut the pleura on the medial aspect of the. left upper lobe adjacent to the hilum. Tumour approaches but does not appear to reach the hilar. resection margin. There is no definite tumour on the visceral pleural surface. Sectioning the left lower lobe also reveals multiple deposits of pale tumour both in superior and. inferior aspects of the lobe. These tumour deposits vary in size from 5 up to 30 mm in maximum. extent. [Bronchial resection margin, 2A; hilar lymph nodes, 2B; vascular resection margins, 2C; hilar and. peribronchial lymph nodes, 2D-2E; tumour underlying pleura and adjacent inked hilar resection. margin, 2F; tumour underlying pleura of left upper lobe adjacent to hilar resection margin, 2G; solid. area of tumour medial left upper lobe no pleura, 2H; inferior left upper lobe tumour and overlying. pleura, 2I; superior, 2J; lateral area of inferior left upper lobe in region of sutured pleural defect (?.

X. 20 X 15 mm in maximum extent. wo bisected, 3A; third bisected, 3B.]. 4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""mediastinal lymph node' and consists of five fragments of lymph. node varying in size from 5 up to 12 mm in maximum extent and one piece of fat measuring 5 mm. [Lymph nodes bisected in toto, 4A.]. 5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node' and consists of a single lymph node measuring 12. mm in maximum extent. [Bisected in toto, 5A.]. MIICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Lepidic extension of. tumour is also noted. The overlying visceral pleura is not infiltrated by tumour, Tumour involves the. diathermied margin. 2: Within the upper and lower lobes there are multiple deposits of well differentiated adenocarcinoma. which in areas show relatively extensive lepidic extension. The invasive tumour shows a predominant. papillary architecture and is composed of mucinous and non-mucinous cells. Tumour deposits abut the. visceral pleura in number of areas and there is focal visceral pleural invasion. No pleural surface. involvement is seen. There is distension of some lymphatic channels. No unequivocal lymphatic. invasion is seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation is identified. The bronchial resection. margin is clear of tumour. Tumour approaches to within 30um of the peri-hilar margin in an area. devoid of pleura. Although this margin is closely approached, tumour is not transected in this region. Tumour abuts the area of diathermy artefact within the upper lobe corresponding to the biopsy site for. frozen section. In a separate area, tumour abuts visceral pleura which shows diathermy artefact. precluding further assessment. Tumour infiltrates one of the lymph nodes within the hilar region. direct extension. The remaining lymph nodes are not involved. Lung parenchyma away from the. tumours shows emphysema together with foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. 3-5: The lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and. mild follicular hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Left lung and lymph nodes (hilar and mediastinal): Well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Multiple separate lesions involving the upper and lower lobes. Largest tumour deposit 165 mm in diameter. Visceral pleura focally involved, no surface involvement identified. No unequivocal lymphatic invasion seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation identified. Bronchial resection margin clear, peri-hilar margin closely approached. Perihilar lymph node involved by direct extension of tumour. Remaining hilar lymph nodes and mediastinal nodes not involved by tumour. Non-neoplastic lung: Emphysema and foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Pathological stage: T4 N1 M1.

It is 5 cm in circumference. at. the open end of the specimen, and 9 cm in circumference at the. stapled end of the specimen. The serosal surface is generally. tan-pink and glistening, with an area with tattoo pigmented 11 cm. from the open end of the specimen. There is a palpable mass within. the bowel in this area, although there is not gross tumor. penetration to the serosal surface. The specimen is opened,. revealing a near circumferential 7.5 X 6.5 X 1.5 cm mass lesion,. coming to within 4.5 cm of the open end of the specimen. On cut. suface, there is invasion of tumor through the full thickness of the. bowel wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue, but the tumor is. not near the radial margin. The mucosa away from this area is area. is tan-pink and glistening, with multiple polyps, ranging from 0.3. cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. There is no other worrisome. lesion in the bowel. The adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple. soft tan-pink lymph nodes are identified. RS-16, according to the. accompanying block summary, following fixation.

PROBE: LSI EGFR/CEP7. EGFR FISH STUDIES PERFORMED ON THE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA ARE POSITIVE BY COLORADO CRITERIA. Number of cells analyzed: 60. Ratio EGFRICEP7: 1.18. SNR (signal to nucleus ratio): 2.0. Hyperdiploid rate for CEP 7: 8.3%. > 4 copies of the EGFR signal: 5(8.3%). Small gene cluster (4-10 copies): 0(0%). Larger and brighter EGFR signals than CEP7 signals: 11 1(18.3%). 15 copies of EGFR signals: 0(0%). PROBE: LSI ALK Dual-Color Break-apart Probe 2p23. ALK FISH STUDIES PERFORMED ON THE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA ARE NEGATIVE. Number of cells analyzed: 60. % of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement: 0%. Only split 0 & G (single o and single G in the same nucleus: 0%. Fusion + split o and G in the same nucleus: 0%. Only single O: 0%. Fusion + single O: 0%. % of the cells with the normal pattern: 60(100%). EGFR FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the EGFR. SpectrumOrang and the CEP7 SpectrumGreen probes. ALK FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the ALK. SpectrumOrange (telomeric) and the ALK SpectrumGreen (centromeric) probes. UCCC criteria for stratification of NSCLC patients: EGFR FISH positive: 1) EGFR gene amplification defined as one of the following: a) EGFR gene to CEP7 ratio > 2. b) Small gene cluster (4-10 copies) or innumerable tight gene cluster'in > 10% of tumor cells. c) Larger and brighter EGFR signals than CEP7 signals in A 10% of tumor cells, while EGFR signals are smaller than the CEP7. signals in the adjacent stromal and reactive cells. d) 7 15 copies of the EGFR signals in > 10% of tumor cells or. 2) Specimens with > 40% of cells displaying A 4 copies of the EGFR signal. EGFR FISH negative: Specimens without gene amplification as defined above and with 40% of cells displaying > 4 copies of the EGFR signal. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. ALK translocation is detected as follows: ALK negative: 0-15% of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement. Normal cells without the ALK translocation show green and orange signals in juxtaposition. ALK positive: Greater than 15% of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement. Cells. with. the ALK translocation show one of the following patterns: One pair of signals (green and orange) fused or in juxtaposition. and one green and one orange signal separated; Only split o & G (single O. and single G in the same nucleus); Only single O;. Fusion + single O. Addendum. The granulomas in the left lower lobe lung specimen (Part 7) and left lower lobe bronchial lymph node (Part 9) show small fungal. yeast forms on the Grocott stain that are negative on the mucicarmine stains. These fungal forms most likely represent. Histoplasma species. Clinical correlation is suggested. AFB stains are negative.",T2,N1,M0,T2N1M0
TCGA-97-A4M2,"A total of 50 cells were scored. FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the. Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23 (. FDA approved). When a rearrangement involving ALK is. present, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion. signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this. specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored. This result is within the normal limits. COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 26.0% of. cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals. represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome. 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in. NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in. lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al. J Thorac. Oncol. 2011;6:21-27). References: (1). Soda M, et al.

Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated. for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in. fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In. particular the test performance has been established in samples of. colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor. these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to. harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,. appendix, etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: 1. Azzoli CG, et al.

Diagnosis: 1.: Tumor-free lipomatous atrophic lymph node. 2.: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins and under inclusion. of an ulcerated, malignant, solid tumor in the cecum, conforming to the type of a poorly. differentiated adenocarcinoma, with infiltration of the lamina muscularis propria and. without regional lymph node metastases (G3, pT2 L0 V0 R0 pN0 0/27). Additional immunohistological investigations are being conducted due to the histological. peculiarities of the tumor. A follow-up report on this will be submitted at a later date. Follow-up report: From an immunohistological perspective, the tumor cells were positive for broad-. spectrum cytokeratins. Large numbers of CD3-positive and CD20-negative or T-. lymphocytes are also interspersed. Based on the histology and immunohistology, this is thus a poorly differentiated. colorectal adenocarcinoma, or cecum carcinoma, with a dense lymphocytic stromal. infiltrate. The poor tumor differentiation and the dense lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration may. be indicators of the presence of a microsatellite unstable (possibly HNPCC-associated). colorectal carcinoma.",T2,N0,M0,T2N0M0

Arising in the. right lower bronchus, 17 mm from the bronchial resection margin, is an. ulcerated friable cream tumour bulging into the bronchial lumen and invading. through the wall into the lung parenchyma. The tumour measures 35 x 35 x 20. mm. The bronchus distal to this lesion shows bronchiectasis. The surrounding. pleura shows multiple subpleural lymph nodes extending towards the inferior. aspect of the lower lobe. Sectioning the tumour mass shows multiple involved. nodes in direct contact with the tumour. Distal to the tumour there is also. focal collapse with or without consolidation. At the inferior (diaphragmatic). aspect of the lower lobe is an area of pleural thickening which appears. unrelated to the tumour.

MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a poorly differentiated carcinoma showing features of squamous. cell carcinoma. The lesion is arising in the region of a major bronchus. Pleural invasion is not identified. There is prominent blood vessel invasion. but no lymphatic permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin. Peribronchial/peritumoral lymph node metastases are seen. The subpleural. nodules are lymph nodes showing reactive changes only. The lung distal to the. tumour shows acute and organising pneumonia. The area of pleural thickening is. a zone of irregular pleural scarring with overlying organising fibrinous. exudate. The pattern of the pleural scarring is in keeping with round. atelectasis. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY.

L kidney"", consists of a 1449 gm left nephrectomy specimen. (26.0 x 11.5 x 8.5 cm) including kidney (18.5 x 8.0 x 7.0 cm) ureter (8.2. cm. in length x 0.5 cm in diameter), renal vein (0.5 cm in length, x 0.2 cm in. diameter), renal artery (2.6 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter) and attached. yellow/tan perinephric adipose tissue (up to 3.5 cm in thickness) The. specimen is bivalved. In the lower pole, 8.5 cm from the ureteral margin, 4.9. cm from the renal artery margin, and 3.5 cm from the renal vein margin, there. is a well encapsulated yellow/red hemorrhagic centrally fibrotic mass (8.7 x. 7.4 x 5.7 cm) compressing and distorting the renal parenchyma and the renal. capsule. Upon sectioning, the mass is approximately 90% solid and 10% cystic. The mass comes to within 0.3 cm of the blue inked deep/perinephric fat margin. The mass focally compresses and distorts but does not grossly appear to invade. into the inferior pelvocaliceal system and renal sinus. The uninvolved kidney parenchyma is tan/brown with a moderately distinct. cortical medullary junction and approximately six smooth walled tan simple. cortical cyst (ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension) scattered. throughout the mid and superior poles. Each of the cysts is filled with clear. serous fluid, with no excrescences grossly identified. The pelvocaliceal. system is moderately dilated and exhibits smooth glistening tan mucosa. The. adrenal gland (6.2 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm) is present and exhibits an unremarkable. golden yellow cortex (0.2 cm in maximum thickness) and red/brown medulla (0.1. cm in maximum thickness). examined. There is no evidence of active glomerulitis, proliferative lesions or's. fibrinoid necrosis. The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by Dr. Renal. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (block A8) were evaluated. using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains. The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 155 glomeruli present, of. which 16 (10.3 %) are globally sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli show mild. signs of hypertrophy of the tuft. There is very mild, focal expansion of the. mesangial areas. On PAS and Jones silver stains there are no discernible. crater-like defects or ""spikes"", and only isolated double contours of the. glomerular capillary wall basement membranes are recognized. Several distal. tubules contain PAS-positive hyaline casts. Isolated distension of tubules is. recognized in the cortical area. Approximately 5% of the cortical parenchyma. shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis as seen in the trichrome stain. (AFOG). Arteries and arterioles exhibit moderate degree of sclerosis, with. focal hyaline accumulation in the subintima in the arterioles. Report Status: Final. Type: Cytogenetics.

TCGA-77-7465,"HISTORY. R upper lobectomy for SCC. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled 'right upper lobe' and consists of a lobectomy specimen. measuring 140 X 120 X 75 mm in its partially inflated state. Two bronchi are present. at the margin measuring 10 to 12 mm in diameter respectively. Two staple lines are. also present radiating from the bronchial margin to the periphery. They measure 35. and 80 mm in length. A large lymph node is present adjacent to the bronchial. resection margin. The cut surface of the lung shows a central lobulated tumour. measuring 39 X 32 X 30 mm. The cut surface has areas of necrosis and carbon. pigment.

A long stitch marks the. pancreatic margin at the SMA and a short stitch marks the. uncinate process margin. Inking common bile duct=yellow,. resection margin at pancreatic neck=blue, uncinate. process=black, peripancreatic soft tissue=green. The serosal surface of the stomach and duodenum is tan and. smooth. The pancreatic head is very firm. Opening the duodenum. reveals erythematous coarse and thickened mucosa at the ampulla. The remainder of the stomach and duodenal mucosa is beige/tan,. unremarkable, and appropriately folded. The pancreas is. sectioned revealing a 4.2 X 4.0 X 4.0 cm white/tan/yellow solid. firm mass occupying most of the pancreatic parenchyma in the. specimen. The mass has areas of necrotic cystic change along the. dorsal pancreatic surface. The tumor constricts the common bile. duct to lumen diameter of 1-2 mm. It comes up into the ampulla. and undermines the duodenal mucosa. The tumor infiltrates into. the duodenal wall proximal to the ampulla as well, extending up. to and possibly into the submucosa. The tumor does not involve. the pylorus. There is relatively poor demarcation between the. mass and the pancreatic neck. To assess distance to pancreatic. neck margin the resection surface of the neck is inked blue and. sections are taken perpendicular to this surface (true surgical. margin at the neck is superseded by the en face G2 section) . The. mass extends to the inked uncinate margin at short stitch and. the margin at the SMA at long stitch. It also abuts. peripancreatic soft tissue.

Mutations in NRAS61, HRAS61, KRAS12/13 NOT identified. C. FISH test results are negative for RET/PTC rearrangement. NOTE: DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. (1). BRAF V600E (T1799A) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2,3). The. association between BRAFV600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary. microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in - -70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas. and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer, BRAF. V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they. have. been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid. tumors,. being found in -40-50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papillary. carcinomas (6). 1.

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For paraffin-embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of. tumor. cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the. platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting. curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by. r sequencing of the PCR product on. DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was. considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal. DNA. Addendum. MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING: Block 1A: D. Loss of heterozygosity IDENTIFIED at 1p, 10q, and 13q. E. Allelic loss 38% (5/13 informative loci). F. Loss of heterozygosity of 1p IDENTIFIED; Loss of Heterozygosity of 13q (RB1) IDENTIFIED. NOTE: The quantity and quality of isolated DNA was acceptable for testing. BACKGROUND: Loss of tumor suppressor gene alleles is known to occur in parathyroid neoplasms and to correlate with tumor progression. As. reported in the literature, parathyroid carcinomas frequently have a mean fractional allele loss of - 63%, and many of these tumors. have retinoblastoma gene deletions at 13q14 (1,2). Parathyroid adenomas typically have lower frequency of LOH, frequently. fewer. than 11% (1). Some studies have shown that parathyroid adenomas and carcinomas often have identifiable LOH on chromosome. 1p,. while. hyperplasia is less commonly, affected by this genetic loss (1,3). However, not all tumors reveal such a correlation and,. therefore, the LOH profile should be interpreted in the context of the cytologic and histologic findings and the patient's clinical. history. 1.

PCR was performed using fluorescently labeled primers and the products of. amplification were detected using capillary electrophoresis on. ) platform. Relative fluorescence was determined for individual alleles and. the ratio of peaks was calculated. i). Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the patient is heterozygous at the. marker (genetically informative) and neoplastic tissue was then analyzed to detect loss of heterozygosity. Thresholds for significant allelic. imbalance were determined using normal (non-neoplastic) specimens for every marker. Loss of heterozygosity was determined using (NL/NS). (TL/TS) formula and reported when allelic ratio for a particular marker was below 0.5 or above 2.0. When normal tissue was not available, peak. boight catios falling outside of 2 SDs bevond the mean for each polymorphic allele paring were assessed as showing loss of heterozygosity.

The tumour. extends to less than 1 mm of the circumferential surgical resection. margin on the right side which is composed of compressed soft tissue. There is no lymphocytic infiltrate at the tumour host interface. Sections away from the main tumour mass contain foreign body-type. multinucleated giant cell aggregates in the lamina propria indicative. of site of previous biopsy. Lymphovascular invasion is noted. There is no perineural invasion. The adjacent urothelium does not show evidence of dysplasia or. carcinoma in situ. There is tumour and ulceration. Sections of the prostate confirm high grade PIN but there is no. evidence of microacinar adenocarcinoma. Some of the acinar structures. contain a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate with an occasional. giant cell and is most likely to represent reaction to BCG. The. urothelium included does not show any evidence of dysplasia, carcinoma. in situ or a papillary urothelial carcinoma. The urethral surgical margin is within morphologically normal limits.

The. specimen is received after formalin fixation and shows the large. bowel to measure 20.6 cm and the ileum to be 9.4 cm. The specimen is. covered by a moderate amount of pericolic and epiploic adipose. tissue in which an 8.0 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm grossly unremarkable vermiform. appendix is identified. The visible serosa is shaggy gray tan to. brown. The wall is up to 0.6 cm edematous and fibrotic. The lumen. is lined by gray-tan mucosa with preservation of intestinal folds. Noted within the cecal pouch extending to the ileocecal valve is a. 4.6 X 3.0 cm centrally ulcerated finely granular tan-gray to pink. lesion with raised rolled borders. This is stated during specimen. opening to be noted at its nearest point 26 cm from the distal. margin and 14 cm from the proximal margin. This has a gritty gray. tan fibrotic cut surface measuring up to 1.9 cm in thickness. This. grossly extends focally through the muscularis into the surrounding. adipose tissue where it is seen at its nearest point 0.7 cm from the. nearest outer margin. In addition, in one area the lesion. umbilicates to the serosa and grossly appears to extend through the. serosa. No other gross lesions are identified. On sectioning, the. surrounding adipose tissue shows several well defined and poorly. defined gray tan nodules measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest. dimension. The largest nodules have fibrotic necrotic cut surfaces. Also received in the same container are three tissue cassettes each. labeled.

Grossly in one area, the lesion umbilicated to the serosa and. grossly appears to extend through the serosa. Microscopically,. carcinoma is present focally extending through the visceral. peritoneum to focally involve the serosal surface. Therefore, this. is staged as pT4a. Eleven of 17 lymph nodes demonstrate metastatic. carcinoma. Some of the nodes are completely replaced by carcinoma. with no residual nodal tissue identified. These are counted as lymph. nodes totally replaced by tumor. Therefore, this is staged as a. pN2b. In addition, lymphovascular space invasion is identified and. the additional classifications of VL are therefore used.

COMMENT: Liver Tumor, Including Intrahepatic Bile Duct, Synoptic Comment. - Tumor type: Mixed hepatocellular/cholangiocarcinoma. - Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Tumor size (maximum diameter of largest lesion) : 12.1 cm. - Tumor necrosis: <30%. Multifocality (more than one tumor separated by nontumorous liver. parenchyma) : Present. - Estimated total tumor diameter of all HCC foci: >12 cm. - Vascular invasion: Present in both large and small vessels (B2, B3,. B8). - Hepatic capsule: Tumor abuts capsule. - Local extension of tumor: Confined to liver. - Hepatic surgical margins: Positive (slide B3) ; see comment. - Bile duct margin (for cholangiocarcinoma) : Negative. - Non-neoplastic liver: No significant pathologic abnormality. - Lymph node status: Negative. - Negative; total number of nodes examined: 3. - AJCC Stage: pT3bNO. Immunoperoxidase and special stains were performed to confirm the. diagnosis and show the following staining pattern in tumor cells: - Chromogranin: Negative. - Synaptophysin: Negative. Arginase: Patchy positive, negative in some areas showing glandular. lifferentiation. - CK19: Strong and diffusely positive. - Mucicarmine: Negative. - MIB1: Briskly positive, with nuclear staining up to 40-50% of cells. Overall, the histopathology and immunohistochemical profile support a. diagnosis of mixed hepatocellular/cholangiocarcinoma. Histologic. sections show divergent differentiation with some larger cells showing. eosinophilic cytoplasm or fatty differentiation. These cells are. arranged in a trabecular architecture. Both the morphology as well as. strong positive staining for arginase supports hepatoid differentiation. in these areas. In other areas, discrete glands within sclerotic stroma. are seen. Luminal necrosis is seen within glands. A subset of these. areas of glandular differerentiation lack arginase staining. This. finding, along with the presence of necrosis provide evidence for a. component of cholangiocarcinoma. Of note, a mucicarmine stain is. negative, indicating a lack of mucin; however, this does not preclude a. diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. MIB1 staining shows a proliferative. index of up to 40-50%, suggesting a highly proliferative malignancy. Negative staining for synaptophysin and chromogranin argues against. neuroendocrine differentiation. Sections at the periphery of the main mass show multiple smaller. nodules, some of which are only apparent microscopically One of these. small nodules is found at the margin (slide B3) It is possible that. this nodule may represent venous invasion. have reviewed portions of this case. and concur with the diagnosis.

A total of 100 cells were scored. FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the. Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23. When a rearrangement involving ALK is. present, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion. signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this. specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored. This result is within the normal limits. COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 59.0% of. cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals. represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome. 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in.

RESULTS: Wild type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of. the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. DISCLAIMER: The test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is. regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical. testing. This particular test is not considered a stand alone test. and should be used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or. clinical work-up related to treatment decisions.",T1,N0,M0,T1N0M0

Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 1.07 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 30% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5. 60 cells were. analyzed in the targeted region. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with.

COMMENT: This case in addition to invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrates typical carcinoid in the right. middle lobe associated with numerous carcinoid tumorlets and diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. A primary lung. origin of carcinoid is confirmed by positive TTF-1 and synaptophysin immunostalning. CDX2 and calcitonin are negative. Surgical resection margin of the right middle lobe demonstrates scattered small microscopic foci of neuroendocrine. cells. However, based on the gross description it seems that margin is negative for tumor and these neuroendocrine. cells may represent another focus of tumoriet.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimens Involved. Specimens: E: RIGHT BREAST & AXILLARY CONTENTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: E6. Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 20%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved. HercepTes (TM) test kit. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. Additional presumptive lymph nodes from part E (right mastectomy) were submitted in 15 blocks, from. E31 to E45. Three additional lymph nodes are identified, negative for metastasis (0/3). PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 8 chromosome 17 signals and 4 to 8 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E6. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 0.95. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapv is being considered.

TCGA-77-8136,"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. Left pneumonectomy plus lymph node biopsies. [Note previous cytology from. Bronchial brushings showing. atypia suspicious for malignancy; bronchial washings negative.]. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""left pneumonectomy"" and consists of a left lung. which measures 240 mm from the apex to the base, 165 mm from posterior to. anterior and up to 50 mm from lateral to medial. It weighs 343 g. The hilum. is distorted by a large tumour nodule which appears to involve both the apical. segment of the lower lobe and the superior lingular segment of the upper lobe. Mucopus protrudes from the bronchial resection margin and anteroinferior to. this margin there is a small firm nodule which may represent an involved lymph. node. The mediastinal pleural surface has a nodular appearance but elsewhere. the surface is smooth. Sectioning of the tumour reveals that it invades the. bronchial wall and projects within the lumen of the bronchus proximally towards. the margin. Tumour is present 11 mm from the bronchial resection margin. The. lesion measures 65 X 60 x 40 mm. The centre of the lesion is necrotic and. liquid but elsewhere the tumour has a firm variegated cut surface with areas of. cream, yellow and tan discolouration. The lesion abuts the overlying. mediastinal pleural surface. Extending from the tumour and into the lower lobe. there is an area of firm yellow discolouration which is demarcated along one. edge by interlobular septa. It extends over an area measuring 55 x 30 X 30 mm. and lies beneath the pleura along the anterior border of the lower lobe. This. area ends distally at a small 10 cm nodule which has a yellow focally. haemorrhagic cut surface. This nodule measures 12 mm in maximum extent. The. remaining lung parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable. [1A, bronchial, vascular. and soft tissue resection margin; 1B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1D,. endobronchial tumour and adjacent lung; 1E-1F, tumour with overlying. mediastinal pleura; 1G, area of yellow consolidation; 1H, distal nodule; 11,. uninvolved apical lung parenchyma.]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar node"" and consists of a single fragment of. reddish black tissue which measures 24 x 15 x up to 10 mm. [Bisected, 2A.]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""No. 8 lymph node"" and consists of a single. fragment of fibrofatty tissue which measures 20 x 15 x 10 mm. Sectioning. reveals a blackened lymph node. [Bisected, 3A.]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a non-small cell carcinoma with multifocal necrosis. The. majority of the tumour comprises patternless sheets of smallish cells with. granular chromatin and somewhat fibrillar or granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Page 1 o. Histopathology Report. In a few areas there is cytoplasmic clearing. There are scattered small foci. suggestive of squamous differentiation in the form of larger cells with more. eosinophilic cytoplasm, larger more vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and. sometimes multinucleation. However there is no evidence of keratinisation and. no intercellular bridges are found. Mitoses are frequent and often abnormal. Immunoperoxidase staining for neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin,. synaptophysin and CD56) is negative. The tumour includes endobronchial and. parenchymal components. A tiny strip of metaplastic squamous epithelium. showing moderate dysplasia is noted in one large bronchus adjacent to the. tumour (1D), and several other airways within the tumour appear to show. squamous carcinoma in situ. Vascular invasion is identified (1D, 1E) and there. is invasion into, but not through, the mediastinal pleura (1E). Lymphatic. invasion is not identified but metastatic carcinoma is present in peribronchial. lymph nodes. No perineural invasion is seen. The bronchial resection margin. is clear of dysplasia and invasive malignancy, although a small amount of. largely necrotic tumour appears to lie free in the lumen. The inked. mediastinal soft tissue resection margin is also clear of malignancy. The. area. of yellowish consolidation in the lower lobe is the result of organising. obstructive pneumonitis. This shows focal cavitation resulting in the nodule. noted macroscopically, but no organisms are identified in routine or special. stains. 2 & 3: Sections of the separately submitted hilar and no. 8 lymph nodes show. reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and aggregates of pigmented histiocytes but no. evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

""Right upper lobe freeze bronchial margins. "" Received fresh for. immediate evaluation and frozen section analysis is a partly. collapsed lobe of lung, which has a small amount of hemorrhage over. the surface. Most of the pleural surfaces are smooth, glistening. and light to medium purple-brown. It weighs 240 grams. The. bronchial resection margin portion of the most hilar aspect of the. specimen is a bronchus 1.1 x 0.9 cm across. This resection margin. is shaved from the specimen and submitted as a frozen section block. Two nodules are palpated in the upper aspect of the lobe and both. show some degree of overlying puckering of the pleural surfaces. These are marked by me with blue dye. The more lateral lesion is. cut across and reveals a subpleural, white and gray speckled lesion. 2.0 x 1.7 cm on cut surface. A portion of this is removed for the. tumor genome project in the usual manner. The second nodule, which. is more apically situated, has its epicenter about 2 cm away from. the lesion mentioned above and has more of a yellowish cut surface,. is well circumscribed and up to 1.8 x 1.7 cm and presents focally. just beneath the pleural surface, also with some overlying puckering. of plerua. A portion of this tumor is also sampled for the tumor. genome project. After preparation of the frozen section, the frozen section remnant. is placed in a block and the remainder of the tissue is fixed prior. to further processing. After fixation of the specimen, the frozen section control is. processed as block FSA1. Additional tissues in the region of the. vascular and bronchial margins are taken after removing staples, in. block A2, which include apparent vascular margins, additional. bronchial tissue and parabronchial lymph nodes. The more lateral. tumor site is then sampled as multiple pieces in blocks A3 and A4,. including overlying puckered pleural surfaces. A5. This is a vertical section taken between the two foci of. tumors, which appears to be free of gross tumor. This section will. let us know whether there is direct connection between the nodules. or not, on a microscopic level. A6-A7. More apical, second focus and overlying puckered pleural. surface. Upon further inspecting the specimen after fixation, the two foci of. tumors appear to be fairly close together, perhaps as close as 5 mm,. and may be continuous as a ""dumbbell"" fashion if connected. A. section of uninvolved lung tissue from the lower aspect of the lobe. is taken as block A8. B. ""R4 lymph node. A mostly dark black and focally yellow piece. of tissue is 1.4 x 1.2 x up to 0.5 cm. It is bisected. C. ""Subcarinal lymph node. "" Three pieces of jet black tissue are. from 4, 9 and 16 mm across. Only the largest is bisected but all. material is then processed as one block. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS. A. Bronchial resection margin negative for tumor. MICROSCOPIC. A. The frozen section control confirms the frozen section findings. of a proximal bronchial resection margin that is negative for tumor. The two foci containing gross tumor, the more laterally situated and. the more atypically situated have identical histology with areas. showing adenocarcinoma growing in scar tissue with some areas. showing more clear cell patterns to the cytoplasm and other areas. having more eosinophilic and darker cytoplasm. Some of the latter. tumor grows in a lepidic pattern including focally into the visceral. pleura, with at least one small focus deposited and stuck to the. outside of the visceral pleura. Deeper sections have been. made of these foci. The section taken between the two nodules,. although not grossly involved, has microscopic involvement of. additional invasive adenocarcinoma which therefore shows a. connection between these two otherwise apparently separate nodules. Thus, I think this is a single tumor with a so-called dumbbell shape. and both foci of tumors making the larger nodules have mixtures of. clear-type cytoplasm and eosinophilic-type cytoplasm. Emphysema is. also found within the lung. A focus of tumor shows growth into a thick-walled blood vessel,. probably a vein. A single parabronchial lymph node is found and is. negative for metastatic disease. B. The lymph node is studied at multiple cuts through the node and. is enlarged and has reactive changes, but does not contain. metastatic disease. C. The lymph node is enlarged, has reactive changes and is negative. for metastatic disease. The case is seen by Dr. who is in agreement with the. following diagnoses. DIAGNOSIS. A. Right upper lung lobe, biopsy with frozen section: Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. CPT 88307, 88331. Parabronchial lymph node negative for metastatic disease. CPT 88305. B.

Mutations in NRAS61, HRAS61, KRAS12/13 and RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 rearrangements. NOT identified. NOTE: Nucleic acids were extracted In the amount sufficient for testing. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papiliary thyroid carcinamas. (1). BRAF V800E (T1799A) mutation has been associated with.more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2. 3). The. association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papiliary. microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARD rearrangement occur in -70% of follicutar thyroid carcinomas. and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hürthie cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer, BRAF. V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they. have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyrold lesions (8). RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyrold. tumors, being found in -40-50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papiliary. carcinomas (6). 1.

Specimens with the minimum of 50%. of tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on. the LightCycler platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR. meiting curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. Single-step real-time RT-PCR was performed to amplify the fusion points of. RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 rearrangements on AB/7500. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR. products. on. AB/3130. Amplification af the KRT7 genes was used to control quality and quantity of RNA and amount of epithella/ cells present in the. specimen. DNA FRNA from samples positive for each of these mutations were used as positive controis. Amplification at 35 cycies or earlier. was. considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of norma/. DNA and RNA,.",T1,N1,M0,T1N1M0

Service, who concurs. RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF NON-NEOPLASTIC RENAL PARENCHYMA. DIFFUSE MESANGIAL EXPANSION WITH FOCAL NODULAR GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS. CONSISTENT WITH EARLY DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY (SEE NOTE). FOCAL GLOBAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO. FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL ADAPTATIONS (SEE NOTE) . SEVERE ARTERIAL AND HYALINE ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS (SEE NOTE). NOTE: The non-neoplastic renal parenchyma shows changes consistent with early. diabetic glomerulosclerosis, as well as extensive global glomerulosclerosis and. severe vascular scarring. Prominent vascular sclerosis has traditionally been. considered part of the structural changes seen in diabetic patients with kidney. disease, although it is important to note that these lesions are non-specific,. and they can result from a number of etiologies, including the. microangiopathies from inherited or acquired procoagulant states, the healed. phases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,. angiotoxic drugs, radiation, and other metabolic diseases, Therefore, a. primary form of vascular injury superimposed on renal damage from diabetes. mellitus cannot be definitively ruled out. Segmental or global glomerulosclerosis is frequently. the consequence of. adaptations for hemodynamic changes and glomerular hypertrophy following loss. of functioning nephrons. Such loss of nephrons is often the result of an. independent primary glomerular, tubular, interstitial, neoplastic, or vascular. disease. These patients often show subtotal visceral epithelial cell foot. process effacement ultrastructurally, and they may be at risk for persistent. sub-néphrotic proteinuria; they do not often manifest hypoalbuminemia or edema. In this patient, diabetic sclerosis, severe vascular scarring, healed episodes. of interstitial nephritis from antineoplastic or pharmaceutical agents, and the. resected mass all may have contributed to nephron loss with subsequent. glomerular obsolescence. Dr. Renal Pathologist, has reviewed the. non-neoplastic renal. parenchyma. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. The section for light microscopy (block B7) contains cortex and medulla, and. was evaluated using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and trichrome (AFOG). stains. There are 187 glomeruli present, of which 47 (25.1%). sclerosed and 3 are segmentally sclerosed. Many glomeruli show enlargement of. the glomerular tuft with diffuse sclerosis of the mesangium and slight increase. in mesangial cells. A few mesangial areas reveal early nodular expansion. The. glomerular capillary wall basement membranes are often thickened, and there are. occasional double contours; spikes or craters are not prominent. The. interstitium contains a scattered, mild mononuclear inflammatory. Approximately 40% of the sample shows tubular atrophy and interstitial. fibrosis. Arteries reveal severe intimal and medial sclerosis with narrowing. of the arterial lumen. Afferent and efferent arteriolar walls show prominent. hyaline degeneration and sclerosis, with extensive ""onion-skinning."".

PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 6 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 3 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. D11. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.29. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

TCGA-78-7633,"SEE SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT BELOW. HISTORY. Adenocarcinoma. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens submitted. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung. measuring 200 X 80 X 20 mm in the fresh state. Overlying the apex and the lateral. aspect of the apex of the lobe is an area of pleural tethering with an underlying tumour. mass. The remainder of the pleural surface shows no specific abnormality apart from. extensive carbon pigmentation. The lobar bronchus has been transected flush with the. hilar soft tissue and has two lumens at this point. Small peribronchial anthracotic. nodes are noted, none of which appears macroscopically to be involved by a tumour. Sectioning reveals an apical tumour mass which appears to be bilobed. The combined. maximum size of this lesion is 32 mm. The more superior lobule is approximately 20. mm in diameter and shows foci of central necrosis. The more lateral and inferior. lesion is approximately 12 mm in diameter and has a solid cream to tan cut surface. In some areas the lobules appear to be separated by 2 to 3 mm of unremarkable lung. parenchyma. Both lobules abut the overlying pleura. No other lesions are identified. on serial slicing through the parenchyma. However there is severe emphysema. [1A,. bronchial resection margin; 1B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1D longitudinal. sections through tumour including overlying pleura and both lobules; 1E, sections of. inferolateral solid nodule with overlying pleura; 1F, uninvolved lung parenchyma.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled ""left hilar lymph node' and consists of three. fragments of focally anthracotic and fatty tissue. [BIT, 2A.]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show two adenocarcinomas. The first has a predominantly acinar architecture with a small. amount of surrounding bronchioloalveolar type growth. Extensive blood vessel invasion is noted and. there is possible lymphatic permeation. The other lesion is a papillary adenocarcinoma. The lesions. are separated by approximately 5 mm by unremarkable lung. A third focus of adenocarcinoma with a. bronchioloalveolar pattern is present within the random section of lung. This measures 5 mm in. diameter. Overlying both tumours, there is scarring of the pleura and features suspicious for invasion. Special stains will be performed. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the. bronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung shows evidence. of emphysema. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. 1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: A: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5. mm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. B: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation. present. C: Possible pleural invasion identified; special stains being performed; clear of bronchial margin. D: No lymph node metastases. E: T1NO (awaiting pleural stains). F: Non-neoplastic lung: Mild emphysema. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. 1: Tumour invades into the visceral pleura overlying the tumour with the acinar architecture. It is not. definitely on the pleural surface. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura by the papillary carcinoma. Both tumours stain positively for CK 7 and TTF 1. CK 20 is negative. This indicates both lesions are. pulmonary in origin but considering their different architecture as they appear to represent synchronous. tumours. SUMMARY. 1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: A: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5. mm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. B: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation. present. C: Visceral pleural invasion identified overlying the acinar pattern carcinoma; clear of bronchial. margin. D: No lymph node metastases.

FISH test results are negative for RET/PTC rearrangement. NOTE: DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. (1). BRAF V600E (T1799A) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2, 3). The. association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary. microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in -70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas. and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer, BRAF. V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they. have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid. tumors, being found in -40-50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papillary. carcinomas (6). 1.

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For. paraffin-embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of. tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed. on. the. LightCycler platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR. melting. curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product. on. DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was. considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of. normal. DNA. Addendum. PROBE: MEC 1 Dual Color Break-apart Probe (. Cytogenetic Location: 11q21. MEC1 FISH STUDIES ARE NEGATIVE FOR TRANSLOCATION. # cells analyzed: 60. # cells with translocation pattern: 0. # cells with the normal pattern: 60(100%). MAML2 translocation detection is as follows: Normal cells without the MAML2 translocation contain two fusion signals. Cells with. the translocation pattern show one fused signal (green and orange fusion) and one separate green and one separate orange. signal. Targeted areas containing greater than 20% of cells with the translocation pattern are considered positive. MEC1 FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the MAML2. SpectrumOrange (telomeric) and the MAML2 SpectrumGreen (centromeric) probes.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used B7. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.15. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. natients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr..

COMMENT: The pathologic staging of this tumor is challenging. We are aware of the patient's CT guided FNA of the right upper lobe. that was positive for non-small cell carcinoma, favor squamous cell carcinoma. It is uncertain. whether tumor in the current specimen and tumor in the right upper lobe represent two independent primaries or a. metastases. If these two tumors represent an independent primaries then the current tumor would be staged as T3NO. If the tumor in the right upper lobe represents a metastasis of the tumor in the left upper lobe then the stage would be. T3 NO M1a. Clinical correlation is suggested.",T4,N0,M1,T4N0M1

Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking. The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR targeted therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21. mutations are present in about 10% of. and up to 40% in the. population, common in. and. associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and. their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy. number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease,. time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitors. Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in. chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4/ALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence. of this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying. patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML4/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with. KRAS and EGFR mutations. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: SUMMARY STATEMENT.

Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 1.0 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 7.1% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 1.6. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with.

For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens,. microdissection was performed to include neoplastic tissue and normal adjacent tissue. Optical density readings were obtained. Gene Sequencing. PCR was performed using primers that flank exon 1 in the KRAS gene and exon 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. Analysis of the.
